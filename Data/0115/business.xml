    <att name="AB" value="Growing evidence suggests entrepreneurial ecosystems are a potent engine for economic and community development. Prior research has identified an ecosystem's culture as serving a critical role in its creation and functioning. However, it is not clear how the cultural forces in entrepreneurial ecosystems develop and are shaped by individuals, organizational actors, and ecosystem-level institutions. Drawing from institutional theory and theories of multiple logic organizations (i.e., hybrids), this paper combines entrepreneurship and management research to argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems are influenced by two dominant institutional logics: entrepreneurial-market and community. By combining both logics, hybrid support organizations, such as incubators, accelerators, and small business development centers, play a unique role in entrepreneurial ecosystems by exposing participants to the two guiding logics. Furthermore, it is argued that intra-ecosystem variation among hybrid support organizations in the dominance of entrepreneurial-market and community logics, will result in a diversity of entrepreneurship within an ecosystem. This theorizing contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurial ecosystems by shedding light on the role institutional logics and hybrid support organizations play in ecosystem formation, structuring, and function and by explaining the genesis of the cultural values that guide ecosystem participants." />

    <att name="AB" value="Innovation is one of the increasingly important means by which companies can contribute to sustainable development. The shift of focus in business from competitiveness alone, to the combination of sustainability and competitiveness impacts firms' capabilities for innovation. This process study aims to investigate what the organizational and managerial capabilities through which companies can innovate for sustainability are, referred to as dynamic capabilities for sustainable innovation. We address this question through a retrospective longitudinal case study of the attempts of the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), which uses its influential position in the value chain to stimulate production and use of biofuel for aviation. The study identifies critical organizational and managerial capabilities that are forming the basis of the successful realignment of a firm's dynamic capabilities with its sustainable innovation strategies. We explain how these capabilities are built and strengthened for sustainable innovation and how these capabilities function throughout the development process of sustainable innovation. This study aims to contribute to a further theoretical and practical understanding of how capabilities are deployed by firms to create and implement sustainable innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="With the increasing significance of the business model in a connected economy, a new stream of literature has turned to explore the antecedents of business model design. Beyond external antecedents derived from a rational positioning view, little research has investigated the role of internal manufacturing flexibility. Based on theory of constraints and business ecosystem theory, this examines how manufacturing flexibility affects efficiency- and novelty-centred business model designs and consequent firm performance. We propose and test eight hypotheses using data from one hundred and eighty-six manufacturing firms in China. The results indicate that manufacturing flexibility promotes both efficiency- and novelty-centred business model designs and subsequent firm performance. Furthermore, the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and an efficiency-centred business model design is strengthened by competitive intensity but weakened by demand heterogeneity. In contrast, the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and novelty-centred business model design is weakened by competitive intensity but strengthened by demand heterogeneity." />

    <att name="AB" value="Identifying the trends and features of metaknowledge will help scholars track knowledge through topics. This paper designs a new methodology to make it in a certain field. The proposed novel design performs well in the interdisciplinary domain where there are plenty noisy data and conflicting findings. This study applies this research design to a typical interdisciplinary domain, i.e. innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. To identify the scope of research and rationalize data collection process, this paper makes a definition of innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems based on previous researches. Next, we design two data filtering procedures, which can handle the noisy data and provide the datasets for sequence analyses. Then, we adopt the co-citation analysis and network meta-analysis to clarify the trends and features of multiple metaknowledges. Finally, we draw conclusions about emerging trends, mainstream and hotspots, current situation, future challenges or other features of metaknowledge. We also integrate some conflicting findings, which provide more accurate evidences for the field. Evidences show that this novel research design is an effective tool for analyzing metaknowledges and also suitable for other fields." />

    <att name="Z9" value="0" />
    <att name="AB" value="Although thereis a rich body of empirical research that uses specific service offerings (e.g. product-related and customer-related services) as proxies for the extent of servitization, the results are inconsistent. We investigate service transitions from an innovation management and resource-based perspective, assessing the service transition stages through the service offering type, service innovativeness and the extent of invested internal and external resources. We use a qualitative approach based on interviews of managers from 19 energy utilities in Germany and complementary longitudinal secondary data. We identify three service transition stages: 1) service initiation, 2) service anchoring and (3) service extension. The findings indicate that firms concurrently experiment with different service offerings and that their services' innovativeness steadily increases during service transition. We contribute to servitization research by identifying barriers in each of the service transition stages that prevent product-centric firms from achieving a higher service transition stage. While in the service initiation stage, firms may face strategy-related barriers, these are often followed by implementation-related barriers in the service anchoring stage and market-related barriers in the service extension stage. To overcome strategy-related barriers, our results indicate that firms should balance their product-oriented and service oriented business model and can benefit from developing a clear strategic intent with relevant service offerings. We further find that implementation-related barriers can be overcome by establishing a service-specific innovation process. To overcome market-related barriers, the findings indicate that firms should integrate customers and external partners in the service innovation ecosystem" />

These four paradigms are advanced mainstream, advanced niche, emerging mainstream and emerging niche. This research also explores three key operating mechanisms with which to organize EV business ecosystems, namely vision developing, platform organizing and institution re-configuring.

    <att name="AB" value="Recently, business ecosystems have been recognized as one of the most interesting phenomenon in software engineering research. Companies experience a paradigm shift where product development and innovation is moving outside the boundaries of the firm and where networks of stakeholders join forces to co-create value. While there is prominent research focusing on the managerial perspective of business ecosystems, few studies provide strategic guidance for how to intentionally manage the different ecosystems that companies operate in. Therefore, and on the basis of multicase study research, we provide empirical evidence on the challenges that software-intensive companies experience in relation to the different types of business ecosystems they operate in. We conduct a state-of-the-art literature review to identify strategies that are used to manage ecosystem engagements, and we develop a conceptual model in which we identify strategies for managing the innovation ecosystem, the differentiating ecosystem, and the commoditizing ecosystem. By categorising the different strategies in relation to the different types of ecosystems for which they are valid, the three-layer ecosystem strategy model provides comprehensive support for strategy selection. We validate the use of the identified strategies in 6 software-intensive case companies, and we provide empirical insights on the relevance and the desired use of these strategies as experienced by the case companies." />

    <att name="AB" value="Building upon the national innovation system perspective and using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis approach (fsQCA), we propose an integrating framework to determine the conditions that lead to high levels of national innovation capability outcomes. We discriminate between five conditions, viz., building national institutions; developing human capital and research systems, improving infrastructures, and facilitating business and market conditions. We do so by analyzing data collected from the Global Innovation Index database containing 74 indicators and 133 countries between 2012 and 2015. The results show no singular path leading to high levels of innovation capability but there are three configurations. of conditions. Two configurations highlight that the combination of three distinct conditions is sufficient for a country to reach a high innovation capability (one in which market conditions 'are not necessary' and one in which institutions 'are not necessary' conditions). The third configuration highlights that the combination of all five conditions is necessary for a country to reach a very high innovation capability. Some crucial implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed." />

We assess the extent to which the use of these innovative agricultural research interventions impact upon the livelihood and productivity outcomes of rural smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan African using a case study of Nigeria. Using propensity score matching as a means of establishing a valid counterfactual and single differencing to measure impact, the study establishes that rural incomes and output are significantly impacted by agricultural research interventions that are driven by agricultural innovation systems concepts. The study finds that participating households had better livelihood, productivity and more diversified income portfolios during the implementation of innovative research intervention as a result of greater linkages to markets and capacity building opportunities; phasing out of the research programme reduced the diversity of income portfolios and led to the erosion of livelihoods. Therefore, agricultural innovation system concepts should be mainstreamed in all public agricultural extension and research programmes." />

    <att name="AB" value="During the past few decades, the configurations of new knowledge-intensive environments have required fertile settings for innovative and entrepreneurial activities. In these environments, Triple Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts where those agents are transforming their roles in the development and strengthening of national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. As a consequence, the phenomenon of entrepreneurial innovations emerged from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises, universities and government on their innovation performance (e.g., access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e.g., distinction of enterprises that develop entrepreneurial innovations or traditional innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section dataset of 19,188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006 to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of enterprises-university-government linkages on entrepreneurial innovations from diverse perspectives and research fields (e.g., open innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship).

    <att name="AB" value="Previous studies discuss how regulatory, technological and market drivers increasingly challenge manufacturing industries to adopt eco-innovations. However, the understanding of the process by which eco-innovations are developed and commercialized as a result of these drivers is not yet well established, in particular because these drivers are perceived differently by the end-users and their suppliers. In this paper, we address the following research question: How do eco-innovation drivers shape processes in value-creating networks? To answer this question, we carried out a case study purposely selected to understand how eco-innovation drivers, such as regulation, market pull and technology, interact and affect the eco-innovation decisions in a given industry. We analyzed the processes in an eco-innovation initiative about retrofitting old ships, contextualized in the maritime equipment and supply industry. The paper makes two novel contributions: First, we develop a framework that can support supply-network eco-innovation initiatives to deal with changes at the regulatory, market and technology levels. The framework includes elements, such as value co-creation to explore technological opportunities emerging from the interaction of the drivers or value proposition development to align multiple actors' interests in the network and agree on shared expectations to exploit the opportunities. Second, we contribute to the emerging research area on eco-innovation processes by highlighting the lesser-known role of value-creating network dynamics. Value-creating networks can be a platform for the development of more radical eco-innovations if actors in the networks can align their value creation and capture objectives." />

    <att name="AB" value="We study the phenomenon of business ecosystems in which platform firms orchestrate the functioning of ecosystems by providing platforms and setting the rules for participation by complementor firms. We develop a theoretical framework to explain how the structural and evolutionary features of the ecosystem may shape the extent to which participating complementor firms can sustain their superior performance. The structural feature, which we refer to as ecosystem complexity, is a function of the number of unique components or subsystems that interact with the complementor's product. We incorporate the evolutionary features by considering the role of generational transitions initiated by platform firms over time as well as the role of complementors' ecosystem-specific experience. Evidence from Apple's iOS and Google's Android smartphone ecosystems supports our arguments that higher ecosystem complexity helps app developers sustain their superior performance, and that this effect is stronger for more experienced firms. In contrast, platform transitions initiated by Apple and Google make it more difficult for app developers to sustain their performance superiority, and that this effect is exacerbated by the extent of ecosystem complexity. The study offers a novel account of how the performance of complementor firms in platform-based business ecosystems may be shaped by their ecosystem-level interdependencies." />

Therefore, in this paper, we empirically examine the network structure of a mobile ecosystem by measuring the technology knowledge flows between firms based on a patent citation analysis of the mobile industry. We found that platform providers are emerging as the center of the knowledge flow activity in the ecosystem. By introducing a new network index, the Network Concentration Index, which measures a firm's knowledge concentration ratio toward subsectors, we also found that each platform provider shows distinctive changing patterns in their technology knowledge network and that each is forming its own sub-network with increased influence on affiliated firms." />

To answer these questions, the authors first analysed two platform entrepreneurial ecosystems in the smartphone app store industry (Google Play's Android market and Apple's App Store) and two ecosystems in the hotel-booking industry (Hotels.com and Booking.com). Second, we analysed the effects of platforms as entrepreneurial ecosystems on the regional development of Daegu Metropolitan City. We used in-depth interview methods with a semi-structured questionnaire, system dynamics (SD) simulation, a literature review, and a statistical analysis as research methods. The results of these analyses yielded the following findings. First, platform business models as economic ecosystems motivate a change of regional development from focused areas to multiple areas, from a hierarchical structure of firms to a network of diverse firms, and from scope and scale economy-based firms leading regional development to creative economy-based firms leading regional development. Second, we identified three category factors that were important in a platform ecosystem, and built up and simulated causal and SD models of these factors. Third, we found that the dynamics of platform ecosystems differ from platform to platform because the openness of platforms produces different effects on firms according to the industry to which they belong." />

Drawing on the technological innovation system perspective complemented with insights from the management literature on the role of incumbents in technological change, four issues are empirically identified as important for improving resource mobilisation for biorefinery technologies: establishing loosely coupled divisions in pulp and paper firms; creating internal markets for new bioproducts aimed at further technological development; entering purchasing agreements with downstream actors; and investing in new managerial competencies." />

    <att name="AB" value="The development of knowledge-based business opportunities in many economic sectors worldwide is often conceived through a silo-mentality, whereby efforts are focused in either industry or government entities in isolation. Without a systemic or holistic understanding of connections between these, any present or future project evaluation becomes either input-or output-based instead of having a comprehensive understanding of its impact. In order to address such a challenge, this empirical study focuses on the Spanish hospitality sector, which currently thrives by continuously accessing external and internal sources of knowledge, thus offering opportunities to conceptualise it as a knowledge ecosystem. Lessons learned from the Spanish hospitality sector have the potential to inform the design of online government services as part of a knowledge ecosystem. This can, in turn, yield further opportunities for innovation in the hospitality sector. A structural equation model validated by factor analysis of 130 hotels is used to assess the extent to which hotels currently benefit from online government services. This study concludes that online government services can be better fostered by nurturing external communities while also setting up internal working communities and practices. The model and its implications can also inform initiatives which seek to pursue ecosystem-oriented research and practice, as well as future policy and technology transfer initiatives." />

This article presents a successful civic innovation crowdsourcing project case study, in which multinational firm Bombardier encouraged a global civic crowd to co-create visionary solutions to the challenge of future mobility in crowded cities around the world. Bombardier recruited a global crowd of 900 individuals and facilitated the citizen development of more than 215 solutions of unique firm value. We explore the process and outcome of this crowdsourcing project and derive actionable design principles for a three-phased civic innovation crowdsourcing process including: (1) crowd construction, (2) crowd knowledge acquisition, and (3) crowd knowledge assimilation. This process enables the crowd to integrate members' diverse and contradictory knowledge proactively at both the team and individual levels. Additionally, the crowd is able to balance extension of existing local solutions and exploration of path-breaking technologies and solution concepts.

In this letter, we reflect on this critique and examine pathways to resolve some of the issues pointed out.

Our analysis reveals that the JP NIS is at an advantage in an industry where consumer demand changes rapidly and incremental innovation is crucial. In contrast, the U.S. NIS benefits an industry where frequent radical innovation is required. Furthermore, we show that heavy reliance on in-house R&amp;D is advantageous over open-innovation practice in an industry where radical innovation is crucial when long-term business relationships are prominent.

We address key challenges faced by policymakers developing innovation strategies for emerging technologies. In particular, we explore ways that FM might be structured to investigate the complex innovation system journeys of novel technologies as they are developed, diffused, and deployed. In doing this, we draw on concepts from technology and operations management and related literatures to more carefully characterise the: (1) 'technical infrastrucutre' required to develop emerging technologies; (2) key technology transitions involved in diffusion; and (3) complex industrial value networks into which they may eventually get deployed. We investigate the extent to which these categories are already used within national technology foresight exercises. In particular, we review over 240 international FTA-related policy, strategy, and analysis documents for 'advanced materials'. We find that - although generally used inconsistently and unsystematically within FTA - these categories repeatedly emerge as important elements in many policies, strategies, and underpinning foresight exercises. We conclude by arguing that these categories should be carefully considered in initial FTA design. And that, by doing so, FTA exercises may better reveal potential 'innovation system failures' and help policymakers coordinate policy actions in response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Based on a case of Danish manufacturing SMEs that developed their local ecosystem in an innovative automation project, we find key drivers and challenges that these companies encountered while creating and capturing value both for them and the ecosystem at large. While the value creation process is enabled by common goals and financial support, companies need to balance their core activities with their commitment to the joint initiative. Moreover, ecosystem development is centrally dependent on the value-capture process, which also takes place at the inter-organisational level. Such open innovation process implies a purposive management of knowledge flows at the level of the innovation ecosystem that fits a multi-layered structure of the business model. Our findings also highlight the underlying connection between the business model and ecosystem concepts." />

First, it is shown that the pinball case is particularly suitable for the analysis of BE. The major BE characteristics can be identified: a value proposition created by an alignment of partners, the central role played by the platform, the presence of three types of members, and interactions among actors that are based on coopetition. Then, the analysis reveals two factors that explain the decline: keystones' inability to change their business models and their substantial dependence on dominators.

It highlights the convergence of nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive (NBIC) technologies by developing a model for the accurate evaluation of different types of options in the development process of convergent technologies. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on theoretical analysis and case studies. The authors conducted six in-depth interviews. The study covered different research projects led by centres of excellence, competence centres and institutions that support the transfer of innovations in the economic and business environment. Findings - The research findings prove that there is a convergence of NBIC technologies that can be observed and modelled. The created evolutionary model of NBIC convergence, also based on the theory of real options, allows a proper evaluation of the entire convergence process. Practical implications - For enterprises and scientific research institutions, the NBIC model could represent the starting point for developing further concepts of investment evaluation. The model also considers the indicators of the innovation system, which, in addition to the marketing area, include regulatory challenges of companies ( competition, copyrights, patents, taxation, etc.). Originality/value - This paper enhances the understanding of new technologies in a digital economy. The purpose of this study is to clarify the principal factors for the effective observation and measurement of the convergence phenomenon.

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the interdisciplinary debate promoted by service research community by establishing the conceptual frame within which different perspectives addressing systemic and multifaceted approaches to innovation are framed. Growing research interest in innovation has led to different definitions, which are referred to here as &quot;innovation system(s)&quot;, &quot;innovation network(s)&quot; and &quot;innovation ecosystem(s)&quot;. The paper examines the theoretical foundations, outcomes, and patterns of contributions to which each innovation perspectives is tied and proposed a subject and the framework allowing an exploration of an interdisciplinary dialogue between the different research positions. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review was conducted to discern differences in concepts and their meanings. An overview obtained using Web of Knowledge leads to a focus on studies, followed by a content analysis using NVivo, which enables identification of key concepts and their definitions. By highlighting relationships among terms, the paper establishes a framework of the ontological assumptions of different innovation discourses and explores their contribution to the interdisciplinary dialogue promoted by service research perspective on innovation. Findings - A comparison among the three innovation perspectives leads us to focus on innovation itself, alongside context, actors, enablers, and governance, which are useful to mark the commonalities and differences among the three research approaches. The framework is helpful to break down the fragmented and sometimes overlapping points of view of innovation and provides a more integrative stance from which to address the emergence of the service ecosystems approach on innovation. Research limitations/implications - The investigation focuses on three innovation perspectives and on top-cited articles alone; hence, it can be complemented with a full analysis through a bibliometric approach to test whether the features highlighted are linked to other elements. Moreover, the different approaches grouped on &quot;innovation ecosystems&quot; perspective suggest the possibility to enhance service ecosystems discourse on innovation by looking at different knowledge and contributions that are rapidly growing in this area. Social implications - The central idea this work puts forward is that after some decades of separation, there is a need to move towards an increasing convergence of economics, business and service based on the milestones of innovation systems, innovation networks, and innovation ecosystems thoughts. Originality/value - This research sheds light on the different ways innovation, in multi-actor and the interconnected setting, is theoretically framed and described. By capturing established thinking in different innovation perspectives, the paper provides an integrated framework to making sense of the full picture of economies and societies seen as complex networks and systems of service systems." />

The purpose of this paper is to focus on how the structure of collaborative relationships in business networks may determine successful knowledge sharing and thus improve decision making and business performance. Design/methodology/approach - Expert interviews were conducted with participants operating in networks and business ecosystem in four different sectors in Italy and Germany, exploring the process of knowledge sharing, organisational learning and decision making within collaborative relationships. A qualitative textual analysis was used to analyse the experts' responses. Findings - The research found that an organisation's network position and the network structure, as well as the governance and richness of the business ecosystem in which it operates, influence its ability to share knowledge, to innovate and therefore to compete sustainably. Research limitations/implications - The research demonstrates that innovative strategic decision making, based on access to appropriate knowledge, occurs within the context of social and business network relations operating within a broader more diverse business ecosystem. Closer dyadic or small working group ties best facilitate trust and sharing of the most valuable knowledge. Appropriate participation in and management of such structures is therefore essential to support knowledge-based decision making, and critical to sustained competitive advantage.

This study frames the &quot;open innovation&quot; interface and discloses ways to accelerate the process of connecting start-ups' demands to ecosystem's supplies. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was used to describe the development of a conceptual ecosystem model to frame the &quot;open innovation&quot; interface and its subsequent implementation at nine start-up hotspots in the Dutch chemical industry. To develop the ecosystem model, the system of innovation concept was enriched with the perspective of a chemical start-up to pinpoint critical resources for growth. Findings - It is suggested that the most relevant &quot;open innovation&quot; interface for start-ups looking to grow is an innovation biotope: a well-defined, business-oriented cross-section of an ecosystem. All stakeholders in a biotope are carefully selected based on the entrepreneurial issue at stake: they can only enter the secured marketplace if they are able to provide dedicated solutions to start-ups. The biotope enables &quot;open innovation in a closed system&quot; which results in acceleration of the innovation process. Originality/value - This is the first study to report on the definition and implementation of an innovation biotope as the &quot;open innovation&quot; interface between an ecosystem and start-ups.

    <att name="AB" value="Introduction: The Electronic Health Records for Clinical Research (EHR4CR) technological platform has been developed to enable the trustworthy reuse of hospital electronic health records data for clinical research. The EHR4CR platform can enhance and speed up clinical research scenarios: protocol feasibility assessment, patient identification for recruitment in clinical trials, and clinical data exchange, including for reporting serious adverse events. Our objective was to seed a multi-stakeholder ecosystem to enable the scalable exploitation of the EHR4CR platform in Europe, and to assess its economic sustainability. Materials and methods: Market analyses were conducted by a multidisciplinary task force to define an EHR4CR emerging ecosystem and multi-stakeholder value chain. This involved mapping stakeholder groups and defining their unmet needs, incentives, potential barriers for adopting innovative solutions, roles and interdependencies. A comprehensive business model, value propositions, and sustainability strategies were developed accordingly. Using simulation modelling (including Monte Carlo simulations) and a 5-year horizon, the potential financial outcomes of the business model were forecasted from the perspective of an EHR4CR service provider. Results: A business ecosystem was defined to leverage the EHR4CR multi-stakeholder value chain. Value propositions were developed describing the expected benefits of EHR4CR solutions for all stakeholders. From an EHR4CR service provider's viewpoint, the business model simulation estimated that a profitability ratio of up to 1.8 could be achieved at year 1, with potential for growth in subsequent years depending on projected market uptake. Conclusions: By enhancing and speeding up existing processes, EHR4CR solutions promise to transform the clinical research landscape. The ecosystem defined provides the organisational framework for optimising the value and benefits for all stakeholders involved, in a sustainable manner. Our study suggests that the exploitation of EHR4CR solutions appears profitable and sustainable in Europe, with a growth potential depending on the rates of market and hospital adoption.

    <att name="AB" value="The increasing amount of global waste reflects the social, environmental, and economic trajectories of the local environment. This study addresses this multifaceted problem that requires a holistic view with an ecosystem-level perspective on waste. The research objective is to analyze how the waste business ecosystem enables value capture and creation. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by using a business ecosystem approach that acknowledges several stakeholders, value networks, and the social and environmental issues of the local environment. We qualitatively examine the structure and process of value capture in the waste business ecosystem in two different environments, Finland and Sao Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil. We identify the key stakeholders and their roles, as well as contrast the waste business ecosystem between a developing country and a developed country to unveil differences in value networks. The comparative qualitative case study described relies on the interview and observation of multiple stakeholders. Theoretically, this research builds on the business ecosystem literature, value capture and creation literature, and the extant literature on waste business management As its key result, the study maps two different ecosysteins and their value creation and value capture mechanisms. The findings show that notwithstanding the strong role of regulators in both local environments and their business ecosystems, some private companies engage in value capture. However, the process and structure of the value capture differ in the two case studies. We also found that the stakeholders and their roles in the value capture structure and process vary between these two local environments and with regard to collaboration for value creation. In Finland, ecosystem-level value creation is not rare, but in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, business models are typically single-firm-centric in terms of value creation and capture. The results presented in this paper delineate and structure the waste business ecosystems in both local environments and provide implications for stakeholders by suggesting the value capture trajectories that can be reached. Finally, fruitful avenues for further research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="AB" value="This study applies a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to data from the Global Innovation Index (GII). Building on the National Innovation System's approach, this study posits that a country can achieve high innovation performance via several combinations of causal conditions. These conditions are the five input enablers of GII: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. By defining two subsamples of countries (high-income and low-income), this study finds that several causal combinations of conditions lead to high innovation performance in both groups. In order to obtain better innovation performance, the low-income countries show more multifaceted solutions. These results indicate that none of the conditions is necessary for predicting high innovation performance in both samples. Additionally, in the low-income group, none of the conditions, individually, is sufficient to predict higher innovation performance, while in the high-income group the infrastructure and human capital and research conditions, on their own, are sufficient to obtain better innovation performance. These results indicate that the political decision making processes required for improving the level of innovation need to be different for each group of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the case of the UK, the first country to have implemented a system of this kind, we analyse how the system has come into being and how it has evolved, and we discuss whether its implementation is likely to encourage universities to behave in ways that are aligned with the goals of third mission policy, as outlined in government documents. We argue that the system encourages universities to focus on a narrow range of income-producing third mission activities, and this is not well aligned with the policy goal to support a complex innovation ecosystem comprising universities with different third mission objectives and strategies. The article concludes by proposing possible avenues for achieving greater alignment between incentives and policy goals." />

Through a longitudinal study of TiVo, a company that pioneered the Digital Video Recorder, we examine how these firms may address this dilemma. Our analysis reveals how TiVo navigated coopetitive tensions by continually adjusting its strategy, its technology platform, and its relational positioning within the evolving U.S. television industry ecosystem. We theorize how (1) disruption may affect not just specific incumbents, but also the entire ecosystem; (2) coopetition is not just dyadic, but also multilateral and intertemporal, and (3) strategy is both a deliberative and emergent process involving continual adjustments, as the disruptor attempts to balance coopetitive tensions over time.Managerial summary: New entrants confront a dilemma when they introduce a disruptive innovation into an existing business ecosystem, viz., how can they gain the support of the incumbents that their innovation disrupts? Confronting this disruptor's dilemma, the disruptor must consider several issues: How might it pitch its innovation to attract end customers and yet reduce the threat of disruption perceived by ecosystem incumbents? How can the innovation be modified to fit into legacy systems while transforming them? Based on an in-depth analysis of TiVo and its entrepreneurial journey, we explore the strategies disruptors can deploy to address these issues. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd." />

Such products may be copies of current branded goods that are positioned as straightforward counterfeits, knock-offs, or Shanzhai. In this paper, we argue that this simplistic analysis is inadequate to describe novel approaches to the production of new goods and that a new system of innovation is emerging. This novel innovation system has a distinct set of context specific actors and intra- and inter-firm structures that have aided the technology innovations and the development of new business models. This paper employs a case study method and uses qualitative data to explore how innovations emerge in new mobile technologies and the innovation system that supports their emergence. It examines the Shanzhai mobile phone industry as a case and provides a first attempt to map the innovation system that has developed. The results suggest that the distinctive characteristics of the Chinese innovation system contribute to the innovations around the product and the production processes. It further confirms the suitability of applying the innovation system approach to Shanzhai phenomenon, and explores new forms of innovation dynamics.

It focuses on IBM's transition from market leadership in a failed path (plasma) to leadership in the emerging dominant technology (LCD) in the 1980s. Interviews and internal documents offer two primary factors explaining renewal at IBM. First, IBM Research had a hybrid structure that captured the benefits of both centralized and decentralized R&amp;D. Second, middle managers shaped senior management cognitive frames to focus on business-related issues instead of specific technical issues, thus bypassing biases often resulting from failure. The study offers an integrated framework on what facilitates flexibility at the technology, organization, and decision-making levels. This flexibility helps firms survive a turbulent era of ferment.Managerial summary: Firms facing technological uncertainty may need to recover from unlucky bets. But responding to failure is politically and organizationally difficult. This study explores how IBM recovered from its failed bet on plasma displays to lead the LCD display market. This study identifies six key factors, highlighting two. First, IBM's researchers received centralized funding, but could also receive funding directly from division managers. This structure helped preserve options and variety. Second, internal LCD champions focused on the business case for displays and not technology. This fostered technology agnosticism and helped avoid managerial biases from failure. For managers looking to use real options to maintain flexibility in an uncertain environment, this study offers clear suggestions related to design and decision making that can foster flexibility.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper analyses the diversity of goals and values amongst 26 Brazilian commercial-scale beef farmers previously identified as exhibiting progressive technology adoption behaviours, and considers the implications for the agricultural innovation system (AIS). Following the Q-methodology guidelines, four main sets of goals and values were identified and labelled: the Professional Farmer (PF), the Committed Environmentalist (CE), the Profit Maximiser (PM) and the Aspirant Top Farmer (ATF). All farmer types believed in operating the farm as a business and agreed with the notion that cattle production and nature conservation are compatible. The PF aimed to run the farm professionally, based on sound technical and managerial practices. The CE put a particularly strong emphasis on the long-term sustainability of the farming system. The PM focused on technical issues to pursue economic returns and efficiency, thereby also creating space for lifestyle objectives. The ATF sought physical farm and livestock excellence, was growth oriented, and sought recognition by peers. These four typologies have implications for the farmers' technology adoption and its promotion, e.g. they are likely to influence the uptake of particular types of innovations, and reinforce the importance of considering AIS within a social systems framework. This is the first Q-methodology study to demonstrate considerable diversity of values and goals within a subset of technology-adopting progressive farmers, with implications within agricultural innovation systems for the integration of goal diversity and adoption theory.

Regional innovation system (RIS) theory has been one of the most popular frameworks for realizing innovation policies.

Social enterprises (SEs) are discussed here as a means to address those problems, particularly through collaboration between sectors and focusing on social sustainability. The aim of this paper is to identify whether and in what way SEs are communicated as an innovative solution and as a source of innovations for economic and development activities through regional strategies. The data consist of regional innovation and business strategies from all Finnish regions, analysed using qualitative content analysis. We argue that there is a need to go deeper and include effective support mechanisms for SEs in these documents. Better inclusion of SEs as part of innovation systems and communicating this through regional strategies would help to develop SEs and to have them perceived as potential innovators and active entrepreneurial actors in innovation systems contributing to economically, environmentally and socially sustainable development." />

What are the prospects for the future of the Chinese national innovation system? Our starting point is the Needham Puzzle - the paradox that while China was once a world leader in technological development, it fell behind; the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe rather than in China. Potential explanations for the Needham Puzzle may shed light on the challenges facing innovation in modern China. We identify three factors that might help explain the Needham Puzzle; assess how the Needham Puzzle and Chinese culture and history have affected the modern innovation system; discuss comparative aspects of innovation ecosystems in the United States and elsewhere; and suggest that Chinese innovation emphasizes exploitation and refinement of existing knowledge to the exploration and development of new knowledge.

However, previous research has paid little attention to how companies can renew their business model to take better account of environmental sustainability at the organizational level in their business ecosystems. This study fills this gap in the literature through a longitudinal case study of the greening of the business model of the US-based carpet manufacturer Interface. The findings delineate the change in the company's business model, stressing the role of managerial agency in organizational identity formation and in making a favorable change in the ecosystem. Hence, the study examines the links between managerial agency, organizational identity, and business ecosystems with regards to business model greening, and it discusses how shifts in managerial thinking have enabled the company to build the capabilities needed for the change. The article concludes by linking the findings to the body of knowledge on strategic change and providing a new conceptualization of a company's business model greening. (C) 2015 The Authors.

    <att name="AB" value="In comparison to the rapid adoption and growth of mobile technologies worldwide, mobile payment services are being adopted at a slower pace than anticipated. One of the interesting characteristics of the Chinese market, for both academicians and practitioners, is that, although m-payment evolved from the convergence of payment and telecommunication industries (traditionally dominated by state-owned enterprises in China), it was private, third party payment companies that developed m-payment platforms, which gained a competitive edge over state-owned enterprises. While standardization, regulation and policy play an important role in stimulating the Chinese m-payment market, these factors alone are not sufficient to establish a sustainable two-sided market and generate a critical mass of merchants and end-users. Although merchants play a crucial role in the m-payment ecosystem, there is a lack of insight into merchant behavior, and their interaction with other actors in the m-payment ecosystem. In this study, we propose a framework for the analyses of the m-payment ecosystem. Starting from a set of propositions, we conducted in-depth interviews to analyze the multifaceted nature of the Chinese m-payment market. We identified the connection between the adoption process and the business ecosystem configurations. The proposed framework can be used as a basis for future studies of complex business ecosystems.

    <att name="AB" value="Knowledge transfer between universities and organizations is essential, not only for the organizations involved but also for the broader innovation system. Understanding the factors that drive or inhibit this process, thus, becomes a priority. Yet, the increasingly prolific academic literature dealing with university-business cooperation (UBC) possesses a strong focus on barriers rather than drivers and only examines few of the cooperation activities that exist in practice. This article offers a comprehensive review and analysis of an extensive set of barriers and drivers across seven UBC activities with a large sample of European academics from 33 countries. Results highlight that while the identified drivers significantly affect the development of all cooperation activities, barriers have more diverse effects. While significantly limiting research and valorization activities, they barely impact cooperation in education. Additionally, results show that even if academics perceive no barriers they still may not cooperate with business if there are no drivers in place. This article concludes by discussing the relevant implications for research, management and policy development regarding UBC, leading to directions for future research." />

In the literature, the technological platform already exists, is the property of only one firm, and is the starting point for an inter-organisational innovation process because it is enhanced and enriched by niche players. This paper considers the case of a digital business ecosystem where the technological platform does not already exist and is co-designed. We study the design process of an inter organisational technological platform and, more specifically, its emergence, its development, and its potential evolution.

This paper applies the business ecosystem concept and studies San Diego as a spatial health and life sciences ecosystem. The purpose of this paper is to identify issues that should be considered in design of innovation policies and regional industry development. Design/methodology/approach - The research approach is built on a literature review of business ecosystems and spatial innovation. The empirical study is based on semi-structured interviews, observations, and information gathering and verification during field research. Findings - The results include a description of the ecosystem structure and dynamics. This paper demonstrates the bottom-up nature of San Diego's health and life sciences ecosystem without a dominant lead actor, and presents prerequisites for fostering spatial ecosystems. Research limitations/implications - A single case may not be able to offer a generalized picture of this topic. However, the study raises several considerations for researchers and decision-makers involved in innovation policy design. Future work should extend the study and involve other spatial and substance contexts to compare findings and to pursue a more generic picture of innovation ecosystems and networks. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates that applying the concept of business ecosystems to the spatial context provides new insights in terms of dynamic mechanisms and factors contributing to economic growth in a particular location. Understanding how to facilitate the creation of successful spatial ecosystems is in the focal point of innovation policies." />

The research made allowed to identify actions of collective efficiency to strengthen endogenous capacity for regional innovation, and also to detect some institutional weaknesses that inhibit the innovation dynamics in a particular rural region (Tagus Valley). Design/methodology/approach - The research followed an interpretive case study, of explanatory type. Data collecting method comprised semi-structured face-to-face interviews with business agents and local government members, direct observation of innovation activities and documentary analysis. Statistical methods to analyse the firms' innovation behaviour, as well as owners and managers' perceptions, were also used in order to improve the trustworthiness of the research. Findings - The results show that innovation is positively associated to a diverse set of institutional factors that shape a territorially embedded innovation system, in which the firms' innovation activity is chiefly based on localized learning processes. Moreover, a path of smart and creative diversification area is detected, but there are substantial differences between firms belonging to agro-food supply chain. While food industries and wineries show very interesting levels of investment in innovation activities and external knowledge synergies, farmers/producers depend greatly from producers' organizations. Research limitations/implications - Given the absence of generalizability and some speculative argumentation, further research needs to be done, especially about the critical role of higher education institutions to promote innovation. Practical implications - The paper provides empirical insights about the role of actors belonging to the governance layer inherent to the territorial innovation system in discussion. Originality/value - The paper fulfils an identified need to systematize institutional factors able to affect non-central regions innovation." />

Drawing on an analysis of urban KIBS firms and universities in the United Kingdom, it is found that the nature of firms, their location, and the research intensity of their university partners are important determinants of the spatiality and localization of the networks they form. The results show that the smallest urban KIBS firms have the highest propensity to engage in local links with universities, suggesting that they rely most significantly on their own urban innovation system for collaborative network ties." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to collate relevant literature on the theoretical background of regional innovation systems and factors that impact the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems. Design/methodology/approach - The collated information is then used to determine the opinions of experts from industries within science-based parks, and the scholars on the researches of regional innovation systems in Taiwan. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to evaluate the critical factors of regional innovation systems. Findings - This study finds that industry cluster effects constitute the most significant operating factor for regional innovation systems within the Taiwanese science-based parks. In addition, this study not only confirms that partners or parent firm location which were advocated by Todtling et al. are also critical to Taiwanese regional innovation systems, but also verifies how well the relationships to partners or parent firm are equally important for expansion the regional innovation systems. Research limitations/implications - The concepts of regional innovation system have been established since 1990, and related articles have been published from European and Asian scholars, however, seldom does literature offer questionnaires or research items to measure the operational effectiveness of a regional innovation system. Therefore this study has developed a questionnaire, by reviewing literature and verifying it by the AHP method, with Taiwan's HsinChu Science Park as the subject case. For the contribution on theories, this study inducted the construction of new innovation environments, new interactional behavior in regional organization innovation, and injection of new resources into regional innovation as the three main constructs to influence the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems. In addition, this study has used experts' questionnaire answers and the AHP method to clarify the priority of factors to operate the regional innovation system. Practical implications - Industry cluster effect, construction of knowledge infrastructure and how close partners or parent firm are (distance and relationship) are the top three factors in HsinChu Science Park. The duties of the government are not merely picking good firms for the regional innovation system, but also making policies and defining regimes, providing a good business environment for campus firms, universities, and research institutions, as well as offering plenty of R&amp;D funding to encourage industry-academia cooperation. Governments must invest in infrastructures, such as: establishing databases, libraries, information networks, the national technical standards for certification, and other public services, to facilitate industry-academia cooperation. Social implications - These research results indicate the operating essentials of regional innovation systems are not limited to interactions among regional organizations. This study suggests that the success or failure of a new regional innovation system would instead, be dependent on the regional environment, as in software planning and support, as well as the relationship of innovation with policy implementation and administration. Originality/value - Results showed that the top-five factors influencing the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems are the industry cluster effect, the construction of knowledge infrastructure, how close to partner's or parent's firm (distance and relationship), import of foreign capital and technology, and the implementation of regional innovation policy." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The growth in popularity of the regional innovation system approach has, in part, been driven by the need for economies to respond to the after shocks of the global financial crisis. At the same time, the author sees the term anchor institutions are used increasingly to describe organisations that have an important presence in the local community and make some strategic contribution to the local economy. The purpose of this paper is to consider the needs of the micro and small business (MSB) ecosystem through the lens of the entrepreneurial university as a regional anchor institution. Design/methodology/approach - Asheim et al. (2011) refers to regional innovation systems as, an emphasis on economic and social interaction between agents, spanning the public and private sectors to engender and diffuse innovation within regions embedded in wider national and global systems. According to Doloreux and Parto (2005) three dimensions underpin the use of the regional innovation systems concept, namely: the interactions between different actors in the innovation process, the role of institutions and the use of regional systems analysis to inform policy decisions. The author has drawn on contemporary literature on the entrepreneurial university, regional systems of innovation and institutions to explore some key qualities and problems around anchor Institutions, networks and national and local policy. Findings - Following the Chancellor's Comprehensive Spending Review in November 2015 and post the changes in the Department of Business Innovation and Skills remit the author wants to highlight the way universities can take a lead role as an anchor institution within their region. The author argues that this role should include providing a wider range of formal and informal support, knowledge and resource for MSBs, alongside the usual SME suspects (Hart and Anyadike-Danes, 2014; Witty, 2013; Wilson, 2012). Based on my analysis and involvement in the the work of the eight Entrepreneurial Universities of the Year Award winners - during the author's time as President of ISBE - He suggested four different ways in which collaboration might be enhanced to ensure MSBs make maximum use of the advice and support on offer from universities playing this anchor role. Originality/value - The results emerging from this work suggest a need for regional policy makers to embrace a innovation-supportive culture, which actually enables firms and systems to evolve over time would be far more effective than those proposed in the latest Comprehensive Spending Review. The outcomes of which will see some of the most robustly evaluated programmes, designed to support small firm growth, closed down and replaced by a commitment (by government) to secure a strong, growing economy, cutting of more red tape and extending small business rate relief for an extra year (Mole, 2015)." />

    <att name="AB" value="Product-Service Systems (PSSs) constitute a family of service-based business models designed to satisfy our societal needs in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. To date however PSS application has remained niche due to a variety of critical barriers. This paper explores how 'demand pull' national government policies could support PSS activity by addressing these barriers and cultivating market demand. Lessons are drawn from a case study of how regulatory, economic incentive, informative and procurement policies have supported Energy Service Company (ESCo) activity in the UK; a sub-set of the PSS family focused on energy service provision. Subsequently five policy recommendations are presented to support PSS activity: (1) balancing economic incentives and regulatory disincentives; (2) promoting indirect policy support; (3) redesigning existing market structures; (4) promoting locally-led PSS activity; and (5) creating stable policy frameworks. The paper warns however that national government policy cannot easily address all PSS barriers, such as customer preferences, international developments, technological progress and inherent business model weaknesses, pointing to the need for other complementary solutions. Furthermore, other governance actors beside national government could also implement PSS supporting policies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd." />

    <att name="AB" value="In a number of studies, the Dutch vegetable breeding industry has been described as a highly innovative sector, but the root causes for its innovativeness have not yet been analysed systematically. In order to understand the factors that affect innovation and business performance, the Sectoral Innovation System (SIS) framework was used to analyse the linkages and interactions among the different actors in the Dutch vegetable breeding industry. Within SIS, five interacting domains are recognized and analysed: the business domain, the research &amp; education domain, the intermediate organizations, the market demand, and the infrastructure &amp; framework conditions, resulting in an integrated picture of the innovation system. It was found that the business domain, the research &amp; education domain and the intermediate organisations do not only show an outstanding individual performance, but more importantly, they closely collaborate via public-private partnerships (PPP), research consortia, etc. It is shown that especially the cluster characteristics of the Dutch vegetable breeding industry, i.e. the geographical proximity and the high level of intra- and interconnectivity within and between domains, induces an intensive knowledge flow, a key indicator for the innovation level of a sector.

    <att name="AB" value="Taiwan's machine tool industry is one of the few industries that do not depend on the support of foreign technologies. Nevertheless, it relies on the development of supplier networks among individual enterprises. This study clarifies the customer value creation mode of Taiwan's machine tool enterprises in a regional innovation system (RIS) by understanding the meaning of the value offered by suppliers to their customers and the dynamic development of value creation models across the boundaries of RIS. In this study, we use as dimensions the customer's perspective of value, the supplier-customer interaction, and particularly the customer involvement to derive the value creation theory. We propose four models of value creation, including a high degree of product standardization with standard recommendations to the customer; product customization with the customer entering into the supplier's process of achieving the customers' preferences; customers and suppliers co-working in a mutual business process to co-create solutions; and the supplier developing a better understanding of customer needs to provide optional solutions. This study demonstrates that four types of value creation have been evidenced in Taiwan's machine tool industry from the viewpoint of the customer, and each type of value creation has its respective environmental and workable conditions. When accompanied by various RIS factors such as customer value creation, this not only develops dynamic growth but also, to a certain degree, affects the growth in competitiveness of the region and its companies. In a highly customizing, flexible, and demanding environment, enhancing customers' value creation beyond their functional requirements while reducing the interaction costs associated with customization may be a challenge for a single enterprise; however, it may prove to present art opportunity to shift Taiwan's machine tools industry toward global competitiveness.

Understanding technological innovations in financial information systems (IS) and technologies has been challenging for technology consultants and financial industry practitioners due to the underlying complexities though. In this article, we propose an ecosystem analysis approach by extending the technology ecosystem paths of influence model (Adomavicius et al., 2008a) to incorporate stakeholder actions, considering both supply-side and demand-side forces for technological change. Our ecosystem model brings together three original core elements: technology components, technology-based services, and technology-supported business infrastructures. We also contribute a fourth new element to this approach involving stakeholder analysis. We investigate innovations in the area of high-frequency trading (HFT) technologies as a basis for empirically validating the existence of several different patterns in the historical path of technology evolution. Our analysis results suggest that supply-side and demand-side forces influenced HFT technology innovations and contributed to changes in the financial markets. This research represents some of the first work that investigates financial market technology innovations at the technology and stakeholder levels. It also offers a useful and practical tool to help managers and analysts to understand the nature of technology-based financial innovations and the relationships between technology and financial markets that support their emergence.

This research examines recent changes in the payment sector in financial services, specifically related to mobile payments (m-payments) that enable new channels for consumer payments for goods and services purchases, and other forms of economic exchange. We extend recent research on technology ecosystems and paths of influence analysis for how industry-centered technology innovations arise and evolve. We explore the extent to which they can be understood through the lens of several simple building blocks, including technology components, technology-based services, and the technology-supported infrastructures that provide foundations for the related digital businesses. Our extension of the prior research focuses on two key elements: (1) modeling the impacts of competition and cooperation on different forms of innovations in the aforementioned building blocks; and (2) representing the role that regulatory forces play in driving or delaying innovation in the larger scope of our modeling approach. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we use it to retrospectively analyze the past two decades of innovations in the m-payments space. Our results identify the industry-specific patterns of innovation that have occurred, suggest how they have been affected by competition, cooperation and regulation, and point out some more universal patterns of technology innovations that offer insights into the development of e-commerce.

    <att name="AB" value="To succeed business around renewables and sustainability often need new types of business models. Business models are typically considered from the viewpoint of a focal firm, whereas renewables and sustainability often require a broader, system perspective. We explore how firms together in the energy business ecosystems develop their business models to facilitate change in the logic of the industry. Earlier studies on ecosystems have looked at the role of technical interdependencies in ecosystems, whereas we use a business model lens to study collaboration between companies. We use three cases from the distributed energy ecosystems to illustrate how different kinds of mechanisms trigger closer collaboration, sustainability and increased overall value creation. Our findings pinpoint the importance of identifying the factors driving the business models of the collaborating firms to facilitate system transitions and change in the logic of an industry.

    <att name="AB" value="Environmental innovation has been discussed from different approaches in the last decade, due to its increasing importance for business competitiveness and as an engine for the economic development of a country, especially in recessionary economic phases. However, the study of the factors that hinder the achievement of environmental innovations has been largely neglected. This paper focuses on the obstacles facing firms involved in environmental innovations and how they still manage to achieve these innovations. The data used comes from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) conducted in Spain in the year 2012, while the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and binary logistic regression are the statistical techniques used. The findings show that the obstacles that companies involved in environmental innovations face are greater and different to those faced by companies which are not involved in them. Consequently, environmental innovation requires different action plans from those for non-environmental innovation; these actions include public funding, and cooperation, as well as other specific support measures. This research provides a systematic framework for environmental innovation and the ways to overcome the barriers to this innovation. Thereby supplying a roadmap for the creation of an innovation system that constitutes a favourable context for overcoming these obstacles, thus bringing about the success of the environmental innovation process through certain critical factors.

Patent data is obtained from the Korean Intellectual Property Office for the years 2001-2010. The traditional Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations is expanded to include additional knowledge producers. The results indicate that the Korean innovation system has become less balanced in terms of technology: patent output has tended to grow rapidly in areas in which Korea is already strong. But the innovation system has become more balanced in terms of knowledge producers: SMEs, universities and individuals are being assigned an increasing number of patents. University patenting has grown most rapidly, especially in fast-growing technologies, in which university-business co-patenting is most prevalent. This suggests that rising public investment in university research is paying off, and that university research is industry-relevant. The data also reveal some unexpected changes: patenting by conglomerates rapidly rose from 2001, peaking in 2005, and then fell. Patenting by individuals has continued to rise throughout the period being studied." />

    <att name="Z9" value="0" />
    <att name="AB" value="In the century and half since its 1861 unification, Italy has left the periphery of the world economy and reached a level of wealth close to that of industrialized core Western countries. Since the 1990s, however, the process of globalization has exposed the weakness of the Italian productive system, and the country's economic performance has been one of the worst in the world. This pattern raises questions about the very nature of the Italian economy, its historical development, and its relative success in the long run, demonstrating the need for a structural reassessment of these themes. The aim of this special forum is to provide such analysis, offering a systematic and innovative view based on the interaction between institutions (conceived as the rules of the game of economic agents), firm structure, and economic performance. The main hypothesis discussed in all four articles is that Italian capitalism has been negatively affected by inefficient institutions that had a strong impact on firms' size and governance, managerial practices, and attitude to innovate. As a result, the Italian economic performance has been frustrated, rather than promoted, by the institutional environment, and in large part shaped by fortunate contingencies. After the editors' introduction, the special forum starts with a reconstruction of the macroeconomic scenario (Italy's Modern Economic Growth, 1861-2011), using the state-of-the-art data and focusing not only on the process of growth, but also on the problems of living standard, inequality, and regional disparities. The second article (Institutions, Politics, and the Corporate Economy) focuses on the exceptionality of the Italian industrial structure characterized by the large dominance of small firms. The authors explain how the institutional setting has played a crucial role in determining the contrasting performance of big business on the one hand, and of small firms on the other. The third article in the forum (The Ghost in the Attic? The Italian National Innovation System in Historical Perspective, 1861-2011), which provides a broad reconstruction of long-term trends in science and technology, analyzes the Italian innovative capabilities in the long run. The authors explain how the institutional setup has determined the Italian attitude toward technological innovation in the different historical phases, and suggest that the Italian national innovation system, from the unification until today, has been characterized by a peculiar shadowy or ghostly nature. The last article (Happy 150th Anniversary, Italy? Institutions and Economic Performance Since 1861), which also synthesizes the very message of the forum, focuses on the mechanisms on which institutions work. The authors argue that Italian economic development has been characterized in the long run by poor formal institutions, which led to a suboptimal pattern of growth characterized by scarce investment in education, low salaries, imitative technologies, and exploitative management of firms by owners who were mainly stockholders rather than stakeholders." />

I argue that Greater Boston's population of small- and medium-sized high-tech enterprises offers a systemic form of opportunity creation and enacting processes for industrial innovation. But they do not do so alone. The population of enterprises is embedded in a regional industrial ecosystem that facilitates ongoing reshuffling of the region's expertise, technology capabilities and financial resources for not only a single company but for a cluster of companies to grow fast. The concept of a regional industrial ecosystem suggests a locality analogous to Darwin's 'small area' in which a 'manufactory of species' is active but applied to the emergence, coadaptation, and growth of diverse sectors.

    <att name="AB" value="This study suggests that in the entrepreneurial communities of emerging industries, individual entrepreneurs may simultaneously create opportunities that spill over to others and discover opportunities already created by others. Extant opportunity literature, focused on single actors and their personal networks or on the information function of market prices, is largely mute on the role of opportunities in value networks with distributed entrepreneurial efforts. Ecosystem theory, a literature stream that seldom intersects opportunity literature, contributes with a conceptual framework to study the question. The paper seeks to shed light on how opportunities are created or discovered by new ventures as they are involved in the interlinked endeavor of forming a new ecosystem. The study examines five case studies of US ventures in the early phase of the solar service industry, an industry in which entrepreneurs offer customers access to solar panels as a service rather than as a product. These ventures inadvertently created an industry ecosystem together, as they could not protect the value created by their business partners' new knowledge, or by the emerging social webs between partners. They shaped opportunities together, passing value back and forth amongst themselves. This paper offers fundamental observations on how opportunity creation and discovery is distributed among a community of entrepreneurs as a business ecosystem grows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="Recent studies have separately investigated the importance of regional innovation systems (RISs) and absorptive capacity (AC) to innovation performance. This study explores their interdependency on the premise that better utilization of RIS enhances innovation performance because the RIS enhances the absorptive capacity of the firm. In this study, we cover three typical elements of RIS: regional innovation initiatives (RII), knowledge-intensive business services (KIBSs) and value chain information sources. This study explores the relationships of these elements on the acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation learning processes of absorptive capacity. Data were obtained through a mailed survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that RII, KIBS and value chain information sources affect a firm's absorptive capacity, leading to better innovation performance. Specifically, KIBS improves the acquisition process, value chain information sources improve the acquisition and assimilation processes, and RII improve the transformation process. This study contributes to the literature by exploring how a firm interacts with RIS by utilizing various RIS initiatives to enhance the firm's absorptive capacity and innovation performance. It also increases our understanding of how AC learning processes relate to RIS and innovation performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." />

Evidence from the global solar photovoltaic industry supports our arguments that entrants are more likely to choose technologies with higher technical performance and for which key complementary assets are available in the ecosystem. However, diversifying entrants are more likely to trade off superior performance for complementary asset availability whereas start-up entrants are more likely to trade off complementary asset availability for superior performance. This difference is largely due to diversifying entrants with pre-entry capabilities related to the industry.

    <att name="AB" value="The concept of business models and consequently business model innovation has its foundation in corporate practice, strategic management, and industrial economics. However, business models are not a strategy but constitute the core and driver of a strategy as well as the key for decoding, understanding, and effectively communicating a strategy both within an organization as well as across its business ecosystem. As with Business Model, the Business Model Innovation literature is not well developed. This paper focuses on the effects that can be achieved through business model innovation, in particular organizational sustainability. In this regard, the paper focuses on the organizational design and governance and the role different stakeholders, predominantly customers and partners play in the innovation process towards organizational sustainability. Finally, the ways by which organizational performance is influenced by different business models are also explored, aiming to shed light on this theoretical gap. The results provide insights to manufacturers in developing countries, overcoming their dependence on commoditized products and OEM manufacturing while maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. Finally, implications for theory, policy, and practice are outlined along with the suggestions for future research." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for understanding core technological competencies and identifying the trends on the technological convergence of a business ecosystem using the patent information of leading firms in the system. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed framework is composed of two steps: time-sequential text clustering analysis for comprehending changes in general technological fields and association rule analysis for identifying the trends of convergences in each field. The authors applied the proposed framework to the patents applied to United States Patent Trademark Office by Samsung Electronics, a market leader of the electronics industry, during the period from 2000 to 2011. Findings - In the sequential text clustering analysis, trends of 14 technological fields such as data storage medium and data processing, mobile, lights and heats and memory are identified. Moreover, changes of technological convergence in each field are identified using association rule analysis. For instance, in the case of technologies related to lights and heats, convergences occurred between radio transmission systems and modulated-carrier systems during the period from 2000 to 2001. However, recent convergences appeared between technologies regarding controlling lights and liquid crystal materials since 2008. Originality/value - Utilization of the framework will suggest new business opportunities to SMEs in a business ecosystem by identifying the trends of technological convergences." />

For this, research publications associated with UK SPs were identified from Scopus for the years 1975-2010 and analysed by region, infrastructure type and organisation type. There was apparently a systematic intensification of R&amp;D from the 90s as evidenced by the publications of on-park firms and research institutions. Science Parks and Research Parks were the most successful infrastructures in fostering cooperation and research production, in comparison to Science and Innovation centres, Technology parks, Incubators and other parks, and HEIs were the major off-park partners for the on-park businesses. The East of England, the South East, and Scotland concentrate the highest proportion of parks, each of these three major geographical agglomerations exhibit distinct areas of scientific specialisation. Parks seem to have a positive impact on the overall level of collaboration and production of science and technology, which are highly concentrated in competitive regions. Nevertheless, industry-academia collaborations show that on-park firms tend to collaborate with partners beyond their local region rather than the local HEI. Support infrastructures may therefore not help to reduce the uneven development and geographic distribution of research-intensive industries in the UK." />

This review identifi es how the importance of localised learning relies on assumptions about the forms of knowledge transmission, the relative importance of diff erent types of knowledge and the role of workers as knowledge bearers. It argues that theories of localised learning imply that knowledge is transferred independent of business transactions, that knowledge is a public good and that knowledge is most effectively transferred through face-to-face interaction. These assumptions contrast with changes that have occurred in the organisation of economic activity. Drawing on the concept of collective invention, it is suggested that localised learning may occur when there is a high level of technological uncertainty." />

Moreover, since these technologies foster users' independence, Smart Homes can be both an answer to an aging workforce and a large market for an aging customer base. Nonetheless, so far market adoption has mostly been limited to the luxury segment and the more basic stand-alone technologies. Therefore, the main question driving this study is why Smart Home technology is so scarcely implemented despite its benefits to an aging population. From the literature we derive key market barriers in Smart Home value networks. We expand on these findings by means of a value network analysis of a Dutch smart home implementation case. In addition, we conducted 14 interviews that provide more insight into the value network of specific Smart Home services.

Energy companies' perceptions of business opportunities are dependent on a set of factors that influence their innovation ambitions. This research operationalizes previous work on the main drivers of the establishment of Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs), with the aim of presenting an overview of the typical systemic drivers within a technological innovation system (TIS) framework. This leads to the proposal of a comprehensive typology and categorization of drivers of RETs. The typology is validated empirically by analyzing data on the development of four types of RETs (wind, solar, biomass and wave energy) in eight European countries (EU-7 and Ireland). The study's results shed light on the multilateral drivers behind the development of RETs.

This form of organising has been successfully used in smartphone, gaming, commercial software, and industrial sectors. Technology ecosystems require stability and homogeneity to leverage common investments in standard components, but they also need variability and heterogeneity to meet evolving market demand. Although the required balance between stability and evolvability in the ecosystem has been addressed conceptually in the literature, we have less understanding of its underlying mechanics or appropriate governance. Through an extensive case study of a business software ecosystem consisting of a major multinational manufacturer of enterprise resource planning software at the core and a heterogeneous system of independent implementation partners and solution developers on the periphery, our research identifies three salient tensions that characterize the ecosystem: standard-variety, control-autonomy, and collective-individual. We then highlight the specific ecosystem governance mechanisms designed to simultaneously manage desirable and undesirable variance across each tension. Paradoxical tensions may manifest as dualities, where tensions are framed as complementary and mutually enabling. Alternatively, they may manifest as dualisms, where actors are faced with contradictory and disabling &quot;either ... or&quot; decisions. We identify conditions where latent, complementary tensions become manifest as salient, contradictory tensions. By identifying conditions in which complementary logics are overshadowed by contradictory logics, our study further contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of technology ecosystems, as well as the effective design of technology ecosystem governance that can explicitly embrace paradoxical tensions toward generative outcomes." />

Given the increasingly salient role of business model, extant literature provides little answer to this question. This study builds a theoretical model based on technological innovation literature, business ecosystem theory, and business model literature to investigate this issue. This study finds that exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation fit with different business model designs to promote firm growth. Six hypotheses are proposed and examined by a database from 176 Chinese firms. This research finds that exploitative innovation has a negative whereas exploratory innovation has a positive effect on firm growth. More importantly, we find that efficiency-centered business model design enhances the negative effect of exploitative innovation and weakens the positive effect of exploratory innovation. We also find that novelty-centered business model design weakens the negative effect of exploitative innovation.

We analyse this process and distinguish between three phases since 2000: new beginnings, momentum building and urgency and review. Within an international trend to ETIS rebuilding, UK experience has been distinctive: from a low starting base in the early-2000s, to system remaking under a strong decarbonisation policy imperative in the late-2000s, to multiple and contested drivers in the early-2010s. Public funding levels have been erratic, with a rapid increase and a more recent decline. The private business sector has played a leading role in this remaking, and as this influence has grown, the role and style of energy innovation has shifted from long term niches to the shorter term mainstream. The UK ETIS suffers from persistent problems: fragmentation, low transparency and weak links to the research evidence base. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper brings together the recent literature on industry platforms and shows how it relates to managing innovation within and outside the firm as well as to dealing with technological and market disruptions and change over time. First, we identify distinct types of platforms. Our analysis of a wide range of industry examples suggests that there are two predominant types of platforms: internal or company-specific platforms, and external or industry-wide platforms. We define internal (company or product) platforms as a set of assets organized in a common structure from which a company can efficiently develop and produce a stream of derivative products. We define external (industry) platforms as products, services, or technologies that act as a foundation upon which external innovators, organized as an innovative business ecosystem, can develop their own complementary products, technologies, or services. Second, we summarize from the literature general propositions on the design, economics, and strategic management of platforms. Third, we review the case of Intel and other examples to illustrate the range of technological, strategic, and business challenges that platform leaders and their competitors face as markets and technologies evolve. Finally, we identify practices associated with effective platform leadership and avenues for future research to deepen our understanding of this important phenomenon and what firms can do to manage platform-related competition and innovation." />

    <att name="AB" value="Planning new product development (NPD) activities is becoming increasingly difficult, as contemporary businesses compete at the level of business ecosystems in addition to the firm-level product-market competition. These business ecosystems are built around platforms interlinking suppliers, complementors, distributors, developers, etc. together. The competitiveness of these ecosystems relies on members utilizing the shared platform for their own performance improvement, especially in terms of developing new valuable offerings for end users. Therefore, managing the development of the platform-based applications and gaining timely end-user input for NPD are of vital importance both to the ecosystem as a whole and to the developers. Subsequently, to succeed in NPD planning developers utilizing beta testing need a thorough understanding of the adoption dynamics of beta products. Developers need to plan for example resource allocation; development costs; and timing of commercial, end-product launches. Therefore, the anticipation of the adoption dynamics of beta products emerges as an important antecedent in planning NPD activities when beta testing is used for gaining end-user input to the NPD process. Consequently, we investigate how free beta software products that are built upon software platforms diffuse among their end users in a cocreation community. We specifically study whether the adoption of these beta products follows Bass or Gompertz model dynamics used in the previous literature when modeling the adoption of stand-alone products. Further, we also investigate the forecasting abilities of these two models. Our results show that the adoption dynamics of free beta products in a cocreation community follow Gompertz's model rather than the Bass model. Additionally, we find that the Gompertz model performs better than the Bass model in forecasting both short and long out-of-sample time periods. We further discuss the managerial and research implications of our study." />

Prior research has shown that the propensity for discovering new products is greatest when firms cross a technological and/or organizational boundary in the search for new knowledge. In this paper, we add a new dimension to this literature: we examine whether, and to what extent, crossing a national boundary, as when firms use knowledge from network partners in foreign countries, influences the likelihood that firms will introduce new products into the market. Drawing on theorizing on institutional arbitrage in the literature on national innovation systems (NIS) and varieties of capitalism (VOC), we propose that companies that cross a national boundary in searching for innovation are significantly more likely to introduce new products. Detailed survey data on firms; data on their network partners, including their location; and regression analysis show that the use of knowledge from actors in foreign NIS has a positive influence on product innovation.

This article analyzes the contested development of Jatropha biofuel sector in Tanzania by anchoring two new concepts of &quot;organizational models&quot; and &quot;institutional arrangements&quot; to the sectoral systems of innovation perspective. The notion of &quot;organizational models&quot; brings into relief the heterogeneity of actors in an innovation system and the ways in which the actors form networks, within and across national borders, to organize innovative activities. The concept of &quot;institutional arrangements&quot; refers to the ensemble of formal and informal institutions assembled during Tanzania's colonial and postcolonial eras, which directly govern innovative activities in specific organizational models. Based on a location-specific and historically grounded institutional analysis within the innovation system framework, implications are drawn for the future development of Tanzania's Jatropha sector including its links with European markets and for the regulation of &quot;next-generation&quot; biofuels." />

In particular, we will discuss the new analytic frameworks that may open as a result of the incorporation of epigenetics in evolutionary economic thinking. This new approach is illustrated by studying the evolution of big Internet industry groups such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and Samsung. With it we shed light on the dynamics of business groups, which we approach as 'business ecosystems'. We introduce the concept of Epigenetic Economic Dynamics, which is defined as the study of the epigenetic dynamics generated as a result of the adaptation of organisations to major changes in their respective environments. First of all, this concept enables us to understand how the dynamics of the business groups mentioned address changes in their environments. Secondly, it is also useful when analysing the results of these dynamics. Abnormalities, malfunctions or obstacles to innovation, and/or blockage to developing competition at certain levels (i.e. intellectual property rights, abuse of monopoly power, etc.) may arise as a result of the influence of epigenetic dynamics. Acquisition of patent portfolios and patent lawsuits for infringements and violations are quite common, for example in the field of mobile telephony, which clearly shows the fierce competition between business groups. Essential patents licensing is particularly at the core of legal disputes between the business groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="AB" value="The problems towards foreign direct investment (hereinafter FDI) have been the subject of debate from the 1980s. The benefits of FDI are obvious: it is one of the main sources of external finance, which is especially important for developing economies. It is highly important to attract foreign direct investments for countries with rapidly growing economies. In order to direct foreign investments into the problematic business areas or problematic regions, targeted FDI policy is essential. However, because the countries with growing economies usually seek to attract foreign capital by any means, uncontrolled foreign investment can bring more harm than benefit. The aim of the article is to develop a complex-targeted FDI policy that would bring the greatest benefit to the state. The authors raise the question how to attract targeted FDI inflows. When selecting a method for the formation of FDI policy, another problem arises: the methods based on correlation-regression analysis are frequently applied in the literature. This analysis is helpful in assessing relationships between individual factors; however, it does not allow determining the complex components of FDI policy. The authors assume that FDI policy is characterized by multi-criteria, therefore one of the qualitative multi-criteria methods - ANP - has been chosen for an empirical study because of the fact that, using this method, not only the effect of a criterion or sub-criterion but also the relationships between the sub-criterion are assessed. The criteria system is based on SWOT analysis. Four alternatives to current FDI policy are suggested which account for the threats and weaknesses that are characteristic of the Estonian economy. The following alternatives for FDI policy are proposed: FDI policy focused on the service sectors; FDI policy focused on the export promotion; FDI policy focused on R&amp;D, and FDI policy focused on the manufacturing sectors. According to the research, FDI policy in Estonia is mostly influenced by its strengths and opportunities. The main weakness is the research and innovation system that may prevent from the attraction of FDI in knowledge-intensive sectors. A repeated synthesis highlighted Estonia's potential to successfully attract FDI and to exploit them in the knowledge-intensive services, high-tech and medium-tech sectors. The research results indicate that attracting FDI to the service sector would be the most effective policy that would bring a long-term positive impact on the country's economic development." />

    <att name="AB" value="Transfer of low carbon technologies to developing countries has been recognized as important in global efforts to limit climate change. Yet the mechanics of international technology transfer, especially around intellectual property rights, have remained a controversial issue in international negotiations. Using a new dataset on international partnerships in China and India in three key low carbon technologies solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and coal gasification/integrated gasification combined cycle and complementary expert interviews we study the dynamics of the transfer of intellectual property and the underlying drivers that guide the development of business strategies and partnerships in the context of transitioning intellectual property regimes in emerging markets. We find that weak intellectual property regimes are indeed a hindrance to the diffusion of certain classes of low carbon technologies: (i) for cutting-edge technologies, (ii) for fully-embodied (explicitly codified) technologies, and (iii) for small firms. However, we also find that intellectual property issues do not represent a barrier to the diffusion of the relatively mature and low to medium cost low carbon technologies that are materially (at scale) most important for carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the short to medium term. Competitive technology supply, shifting market dynamics, and increasingly vigorous domestic innovation coupled with mechanisms and opportunities to structure credible intellectual property deals allow for the diffusion of key low carbon technologies to occur within the context of existing business, political, and institutional structures.

    <att name="AB" value="Globalisation and structural and demographic change are presenting Japan's economy and many regional economies with major challenges. In earlier decades, the international transfer of technology was an important factor in Japan's rise to become one of the leading industrialised nations. Today, however, the focus is on the interregional and intraregional transfer of technology between research institutions and private firms when addressing the issue of national and regional competitiveness. Regional innovation policies, in particular those under the responsibility of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and its regional bureaus, have for several years been making a great effort to promote the intraregional transfer of technology and business start-ups. This paper investigates the structure, the spatial reach and the innovation performance of R&amp;D networks that have built up as part of a regional development programme financed by METI. A social network analysis is carried out using a unique data set of joint research projects of public research institutions, private firms and government institutions. The results show that the spatial patterns of R&amp;D networks depend on the technical field of the research projects as well as on the role of the parties involved. Academia-academia cooperations have a much greater spatial reach than cooperations with private firms. The public sector plays an important role in local innovation processes." />

    <att name="AB" value="The US national innovation system has a dual structure: part suited to rapid innovation, and part stubbornly resistant to change. The complex, established Legacy sectors' that resist change, particularly disruptive innovation, share common features that obstruct the market launch of innovations, over and above the valley of death' and other obstacles that have been the traditional focus of innovation policy. Innovations in Legacy sectors must penetrate a well-established and well-defended technological/economic/political/social paradigm that favours existing technology, characterised by (1) perverse' subsidies and price structures that create a mismatch between the incentives of producers and broader social goals, such as environmental sustainability, public health and safety, and geopolitical security; (2) established infrastructure and institutional architecture that imposes regulatory hurdles or other disadvantages to new entrants (3) market imperfections beyond those faced by other innovations: network economies, lumpiness, economies of scale, split incentives, needs for collective action, and transaction costs (4) politically powerful vested interests, reinforced by public support, that defend the paradigm and resist innovations that threaten their business models (5) public habits and expectations attuned to existing technology and (6) an established knowledge and human resources structure adapted to its needs. Beyond these obstacles, more socially desirable technologies that are driven by environmental or other non-market considerations must overcome the lack of agreed replacement standards against which putative alternatives can be judged. We have developed a new, integrative analytic framework for categorising the obstacles to market launch faced by Legacy sectors, and earlier applied this method to energy, health delivery, the long-distance electric grid, building, and air transport. In energy especially, the requirement for innovation is sufficiently urgent that large-scale domestic and collaborative international research should take place even at the cost of possible competitive disadvantage and even if it is some time before the USA adopts carbon charges and thereby puts pressure on the prevailing paradigm of fossil fuel use. We now extend this method to sustainable agriculture. American paradigms in agriculture and in energy are exported worldwide, delaying the development and spread of needed innovations that are not consistent with them. Foreign manufacturers wishing to enter US markets must suit their products in these sectors to American paradigms, while American exports of technology may be insufficiently cost conscious or respectful of environmental sustainability. Developing countries are technology takers and suffer from asymmetric innovative capability. They need to choose sources of technology best suited to their situation. India and China constitute new competitive threats, but also represent innovative developing countries' that have large domestic markets in which they are launching innovations aimed at their lower income populations." />

    <att name="AB" value="Norway has built up a remarkable solar photovoltaic (PV) industry over the last 15 years with central industrial players such as the Renewable Energy Corporation Group and Elkem. Norwegian companies are mainly active in manufacturing materials for solar cells, but also other elements of the value chain for solar PVs, such as manufacturing of solar cells, recycling of silicone and of solar cells have become a business target. Analyses of industry and innovation dynamics in renewable energy technology have been dominated by the technological innovation systems (TISs) approach. This paper seeks to complement existing TIS analyses by drawing explicitly on the regional innovation system approach to analyse the spatially differentiated development of solar PV industry in Norway. The historical account of the Norwegian PV industry and network analyses of its knowledge dynamics display a marked spatial pattern of both intra- and inter-regional industrial development. With its origin in Oslo-based Elkem, an industrial branching process took place which partly reinforced the Oslo region as a localized cluster for the PV industry and partly initiated the built-up of industrial activities in other regions. The latter process illustrates how PV industry emergence drew on knowledge spillovers from incumbent process industries through related variety. In contrast, the former drew to a great extent on urbanization advantages because of the regional knowledge infrastructure in and around Oslo. While this spatial unevenness perhaps has facilitated the built-up of industry, it also poses considerable limitations and challenges in the longer term." />

    <att name="AB" value="Over the last four decades, the dynamics of innovation in the US economy have shifted. Whereas the development of new technologies was once dominated by large, vertically integrated firms, since the 1980s an increasingly networked innovation environment has emerged in which small firms play a central role. But why did this shift emerge? Extant research emphasizes changes in the decision-making calculus of large firms, the rise of private venture capital, legal changes and a variety of subnational development initiatives. In this paper, we demonstrate the critical importance of government innovation programs. We argue that a single small, relatively unknown programuthe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programuplayed a critical role in catalyzing this broader economic transformation. Drawing on programmatic data, employment trends and data on SBIRs intersection with venture capital and federal procurement, we show how SBIR catalyzed a series of cross-cutting institutional mechanisms that supported the growth of small, innovative technology firms.

    <att name="AB" value="Sustainable strategic management emerged from the coevolution of strategic thinking in today's sustainability challenging business environment. Business ecosystems, designed to create socially and ecologically responsible economic opportunities for their members, have emerged as excellent structures for implementing sustainable strategic management strategies along the whole pyramid of coevolving developed, developing, and undeveloped markets. Both the business ecosystem leaders and niche players in these whole pyramid business ecosystems have critical roles to play in formulating and implementing potentially profitable strategies that help reduce the human footprint and improve the quality of human life. Ecosystem leaders need to be responsible for creating and shepherding their business ecosystems' visions of a sustainable future, and niche players need to be responsible for providing the ecosystem with an innovation trajectory designed to make those visions a reality." />

    <att name="AB" value="This paper poses the question of whether innovation policies are customized to meet the varying needs of different regions and industries. The research questions are: (a) are the investigated innovation initiatives context sensitive and customized to the prevailing innovation problems and, hence, to what extent do they focus on overcoming specific bottlenecks in the particular regional innovation system and address system failures hampering innovation; (b) have innovation policies aiming to support specific industries recognized the differences and, if yes, have they been customized accordingly? The paper discusses emerging forms of local/regional innovation policy using, as cases in point, Finland and especially two different industries (intelligent machinery and digital content services) in three different kinds of regional innovation system. The empirical research is based on data gathered (a) through 40 interviews with Finnish innovation policy makers and (b) through 91 structured interviews with firm representatives; (c) in addition, interview data from another study with 53 national-level innovation policy makers are exploited. The empirical analysis shows that, in spite of a shared understanding about the generic principles of the innovation policy and the investigated local/regional policy, initiatives are clearly customized to serve the current challenges of the specific regions and industries." />

    <att name="AB" value="Several studies have emphasized the role of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) in fostering innovation in metropolitan areas and regional innovation systems. Such areas are capable of expressing a strong demand for KIBS and consequently stimulate the rise and growth of KIBS. Despite an abundance of literature on KIBS emphasizing the relevance of spatial proximity to customers, many KIBS develop relationships on a broader national or even international scale. No studies have focused explicitly on this apparent discrepancy as yet. The aim of this paper is therefore to fill this theoretical and empirical gap by explaining the firm-level factors relating to the market extension of KIBS within the framework of regional innovation systems. Our analysis is based on a quantitative study on more than 150 KIBS supplying design or communication services located in the Veneto region (north-eastern Italy), an area that can be described as a regional innovation system. Five variables were considered, that is, size, experience, service standardization, investments in network technologies and relational intensity. Our results confirm that three of these variables, but not service standardization and relational intensity, correlate positively with the market extension of KIBS. Policy implications are also discussed." />

    <att name="AB" value="It is widely acknowledged that the rate of innovations can be enhanced through interaction between new constellations of actors, crossing borderlines between different mindsets, knowledge and skill bases (e.g. Brown and Duguid, Org Sci 2(1):40-57, 1991; Cooke and Morgan, The associational economy: firms, regions, and innovation, 1998; Leonard-Barton, Wellsprings of knowledge: building and sustaining the sources of innovation, 1995, p. 64; Stamm, Managing innovation, design and creativity, 2008, p. 335). Studies of economic prosperity have also pointed to cooperation and competition between neighboring actors as a driver for competitiveness and innovativeness, be it for a company, a business area or a region (e.g. Piore and Sabel, The second industrial divide: possibilities for prosperity, 1984; Porter, The competitive advantage of nations, 1990). The hypothesis behind the geographical focus is that geographical proximity between actors promotes interaction and hence innovation. In EU, and also in Norway, this has been used actively as guidance in national and regional policy, where construction of innovation systems such as clusters and interorganizational networks are promoted and funded. To get organizations and institutions in a region to collaborate more is seen as the panacea for innovation, transformation and prosperity. However, companies often treat such constructed initiatives as an add-on to their ordinary, often long-lasting, business relationships between customers and suppliers (HAyenkansson et al., Business in networks, 2009, p. 13). This could imply that the necessary anchoring of such new innovation system initiatives with the companies' own innovation processes is weak or missing. The terminology system points to the importance of the different elements (actors) in the system, their interrelatedness and their impact on each other (Meadows, Thinking in systems. A primer, 2009). An innovation system, like a network, cannot deliver innovation if the elements (i.e. the companies) of the systems don't respond with related actions to the common endeavor. However, the different actors' intraorganizational innovation processes are hardly mentioned in the innovation systems theories, thus lacking the important system feedback link between the intraorganizational innovation processes within the single company and the interorganizational innovation processes which are taking place in the collaborative initiative. In this article it is argued, supported by a case story, that attention to both of these processes and the nexus between them is needed in order to construct sustainable interorganizational innovation system initiatives. A model for this is proposed, based on a dual organization development process, encouraging system feedback loops and thereby bridging the single participating organization and the interorganizational collaborative initiative." />

In these ecosystem contexts, organizations are required to manage their innovation processes in increasingly networked and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce the technology and ecosystem clockspeed measures that can be used to assess the temporal nature of technological changes in a business ecosystem. We analyze systemic changes in the personal computer (PC) ecosystem, explicitly focusing on subindustries central to the delivery of PC gaming value to the end user. Our results show that the time-based intensity of technological competition in intertwined subindustries of a business ecosystem may follow various trajectories during the evolution of the ecosystem. Hence, the technology and ecosystem clockspeed measures are able to pinpoint alternating dynamics in technological changes among the subindustries in the business ecosystem. We subsequently discuss organizational considerations and theoretical implications of the proposed measures." />

Because of their newness, entrepreneurial ventures are especially susceptible to institutional vacuums. This research seeks to shed light on the role that business groups can play in the development of entrepreneurial ventures in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach - Based on detailed fieldwork, the study describes and analyzes the creation and evolution of two biotechnology start-ups that were affiliated to a major Latin American business group. The research covers the period between their foundation and later acquisition by a multinational company. Findings - The article discusses the role that the business group affiliation had in terms of helping the start-ups to interact with multiple institutional voids. The analysis shows that the start-ups benefited from the group's reputation and connections, experience and know-how in managing different types of businesses in the country; strong resource base, long-term vision, and strong organizational culture. Originality/value - The main contribution of this work is to show that business group affiliation can be an interesting solution that facilitates the development of entrepreneurial ventures in emerging markets." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the dominant strategy and business models of companies and to analyse the awareness of design and the stage of design application in business in its broader sense from the perspective of business executives in the manufacturing sector and professional designers in the design industry that lead to creating successful business models in Latvia and Estonia. Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire was used with two target groups business executives (based on NACE 2, B-E sections, ie. manufacturing companies) and professional designers in the design industry (NACE 2, M 74.10 section). In the first target group, 374 responses of business executives in Latvia and 371 responses of business executives in Estonia were received; in the second target group, 85 respondents in Latvia and 42 respondents in Estonia providing professional design services were analysed to identify the level of design awareness and its application in business in the respective countries. Findings - There are national and regional specifics in Latvia and Estonia based on the development level of micro and macro factors that influence the entire innovation ecosystem. When comparing both countries in these terms, both target groups specify that design is applied more frequently in the processes of product development in Estonia, thus leading to new forms of innovation, than it is in Latvia. Conversely, in Latvia, many business managers still focus on short-term business solutions and cost-reduction as a sole challenge, with limited awareness of management approaches based on the broader application of design as a powerful innovation source for product development, improvement, and renewal of business models. Research limitations/implications - A suggestion for further research is to replicate the study in Lithuania and explore the perspective of other stakeholders. Practical implications - The results of this research demonstrate the necessity to change the thinking patterns of business managers in order to develop their skills and capabilities to recognize emerging new driving forces of innovation unfolding through awareness of design and opportunities for its extended application that create successful business models for continuous value generation. Originality/value - This paper makes a contribution to understanding the current stage of awareness of design and its application in the manufacturing sector in the Baltic States." />

We are concerned with Churchman's sweeping in of alternative perspectives and with inductive research. The potential for innovation that concepts from external disciplines bring is balanced by the risks of working outside a researcher's area of expertise. There is potential for researcher bias when gathering new ideas as well as when filtering possible new theory, and a protocol might help minimize such problems. For example, few business researchers are fully versed in ecology, and vice versa. This applies to the authors here, but we look at the issue from our respective sides and bring our respective expertise. Hierarchy theory is fundamentally a theory of observation. Here it helps us to define how the perspective of the researcher affects theory construction and the use of transdisciplinary concepts. It introduces a precision about the use of levels and brings out the dualism that arises in movement between levels. We use this to develop a theoretical model of the theory-building process that avoids bias whilst making best use of the researcher's preconceptions. We illustrate our protocol using the business ecosystem metaphor, which is common in the business literature.

    <att name="Z9" value="1" />
    <att name="AB" value="Background: Biotechnology complements technological developments in main sectors of economies, such as health, energy, and agriculture, and thus contributes to economic development. It provides solutions to the problems that are frequently faced in developing economies, such as resource constraints, lower productivity and environmental concerns. In order to benefit from biotechnology, its associated markets need to develop and function well to support the developments and transactions of intangible assets, such as technology transfers, license agreements and research and development joint ventures. Economic valuation of the intangible assets is necessary for the development and functioning of these markets. It provides better understanding of value creation at micro scales and its economic and financial dynamics. The literature lacks valuation studies in biotechnology sectors in developing economies. This study performs economic valuation analysis of a research and development project of a Turkish biotechnology company operating in health sector. Turkey, as a developing economy, has slow progress in biotechnology despite its wealth of biological resources and genetic variety. Thus, the study provides an excellent case to analyze valuation issues in developing economies. It uses data from in-depth interviews from the company and employs real options and discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. Results: Developing countries and biotechnology sector introduce additional risks that need to be accounted for in valuation. These risks reduce the value of the project under real options and discounted cash flow methods. Since real options method permits the valuation of options that might arise during the R&amp;D process and provides flexibility to managers to act, it results in higher values compared to discounted cash flow method. The grant from a public institution that partially financed the Project reduces the discount factor and thus increases the value of it. Conclusions: Economic values of biotechnology intangibles in developing countries are affected by country and sector risks and public financing. Thus, both microeconomic and macroeconomic policy interventions are important for the development of biotechnology in these economies. While public financing enables the risky R&amp;D projects to take place, it makes them more valuable than they would be under no intervention. Long run effects of these interventions require diligent analyses." />

One of the models that emphasizes on cohesiveness as a precondition for viability is the viable system model (VSM). In this study, we adopt the VSM in combination with theories of innovation and innovation system as our conceptual framework to describe and explain the functions and relational structure that exist among agencies/institutions and that of the agencies with their environment elements within one policy level system implementation. We select a biotechnology industry development policy for our analysis, the implementation of which has been designated as a strategic vehicle to support the economic development goals of an emerging economy. The findings, which generate a model of the policy-level system implementation, explain the operating agencies' functions and their inter-relationships. The emergent model provides policy makers and implementers recommendations for improvements, as well as offers future researchers potential for comparison between existing performance of a policy implementation against its expected performance targets. The study concludes that the biotechnology industry development is an effort by the Malaysian government to institutionalize biotechnology businesses and industry. The perspective of systems thinking, in combination with theories of institutionalization, innovation and innovation system, provide important foundations in explaining technology-based industry development. All these findings highlight that the knowledge gain in explaining and interpreting the problem in focus is worthwhile, although the use of VSM as a research tool demands considerable efforts." />

In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the network structure of an industrial cluster and compare its results with that of a field study, and found that firms in the cluster do not regard it as dense, which means that there are opportunities even in the densest network. This is because it is not so easy to look for business partners beyond a company's current partnerships while tight communication exists among firms having partnerships.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper draws on research commissioned to investigate the regional innovation system of Wales on green innovation, focusing on the renewable energy sub-sectors of wind, solar and biomass. It shows how many innovative firms operate within regional networks, cooperating and interacting not only with other firms such as suppliers, customers and competitors, but also with research and technology resource organizations, innovation support agencies, venture capital funds, and local and regional government bodies. The paper argues that within the region there is the presence of various renewable energy production platforms, usually based on core technologies (wind, solar, biomass, marine, etc.) at different levels of development. They involve a mix of established energy utilities and new sustainable energy businesses that are positioned at different levels within the renewable energy supply chain. The research shows that the regional government is playing an important role in supporting the renewable energy industry; nevertheless, more needs to be done to facilitate planning control, provide skills and create new demands for renewable energy that will further foster business growth and further strengthen the existing manufacturing base and innovation in Wales. The paper identifies some weaknesses in the Welsh energy innovation system, not least that energy is not a devolved responsibility and it argues that there is some scope for the Welsh Assembly Government to further investigate gaps within the green innovation supply chain and act on strengthening regional capabilities within the industry but also to support and investigate further opportunities for inward investment." />

The public sector is responsible for policy formation and preparation for innovation expansion at the state level. In the expert works different innovation indexes are used in order to assess the value of innovation expression as well as the effectiveness of NIS functioning in the state level. The main peculiarities of these indexes are highlighted in the article. The article solves the scientific problem which is directly correlated with the situation that there is no unit classification of possible indexes (models) for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. According to all arguments mentioned, the authors of this article raise the aim to use analytical (theoretical) as well as empirical methods to systematize the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level as well as to present possible methods and areas of it's application (Lithuania's case). To achieve this aim free tasks were solved in the article: to highlight the main peculiarities of existing indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to systematize the groups of quantitative and qualitative criteria as well as to perform empirical research in order to present the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to provide the possible methods and areas of application of evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. The essential result of the research was the classification of possible indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level into two groups. Using the comparison method, all criteria were systematized into 14 quantitative and 11 qualitative criteria. As the consequence of selection of criteria the basic frequently recurrent groups where highlighted (human resource, innovators, economic effect, environment, investment for education, conditions for business provided by public institutions, general infrastructure, scientific output, knowledge creation, investor and creditor conditions, entrepreneurship). The empirical research enabled to specify and adapt for Lithuania the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. Finally the possible methods and areas of application of evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level were presented in the article." />

It discusses, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the increasing use of green IT and their applications (IT for green). IT and sustainable development have had a concomitant rise and reach. The future world emerging from their respective interpretations enables, in both cases, a shift from today's questionable industrial capitalism towards post-industrial capitalism. This paper addresses the following questions: What is known about green IT and IT for green? Are smart solutions (buildings, energy grids, transport) always beneficial to an ecological economy? And, if so, in what ways? In the first part of this article, we analyse the economic, social and environmental impact of IT and argue for the need for green applications of green IT in order to achieve sustainable outcomes. The second part focuses on the managerial dimension of eco-innovation theory and presents one of the distinctive features of green applications of green IT: the collective organisation of innovation. A typology of eco-innovation aimed at reconciling IT development and green growth is then proposed explicitly addressing four kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social, institutional and organisational innovation.

Subsequent sectors, repeating the successful model created by and catalyzed from the semiconductor sector are flourishing; the thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) and integrated circuit (IC) design sectors have been growing rapidly since the beginning of the 2000s, and the solar photovoltaic and LED (Light-Emitting Diode) sectors emerged quickly in mid-2005. The continuous evolving and growing industries along with the significant increase of value added in the Hsinchu Science Park have demonstrated it is acting as a healthy and vivid innovation region. The policy implications derived from this study can thus shed light, for the Southeast Asian, Latin American or other latecomers, on the strategies for formulating regional research and innovation policies in the process of developing a knowledge-based economy." />

It found that government funding generally has a positive effect on innovation output at the firm level. When it comes to the level of innovativeness, however, it is revealed that government financial support has a positive, but statistically insignificant, effect on achieving high innovativeness. This finding is especially noteworthy considering how hard the government has tried to level up the novelty of its national innovation system, promoting enterprises to being developers and not just adopters in the innovation process.

    <att name="Z9" value="19" />
    <att name="AB" value="Several notions of a R&amp;D paradox can be found in the literature. In the Swedish Paradox version, the emphasis is normally on high and growing levels of business R&amp;D connected to comparatively low GDP growth rates. This paper examines whether this pattern is consistent over time and, more importantly, which sectors drive the aggregate patterns. Based on an investigation of the entire Swedish economy 1985-2001, there is clear evidence that the paradox occurs only in fast-growing manufacturing and service sectors. Fast-growing sectors show an increasing gap between R&amp;D and value-added growth, while the slow-growing sectors do not. This paradox is not interpreted as a sign of failure of the national innovation system, as the largest gap would then be for the slow-growing sectors, failing to transform R&amp;D to economic growth. The gap between R&amp;D and GDP is consistent with the idea of diminishing marginal returns to R&amp;D investment in high-investing sectors. The evidence does not rule out, however, that rendering the innovation system more effective could yield better outcomes. As the findings of a gap are quite consistent over time, it seems fair to conclude that businesses have good reasons for their high R&amp;D investments, despite not being on par with their production growth.

    <att name="AB" value="Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly depicted as an important element of the carbon dioxide mitigation portfolio. However, critics have warned that CCS might lead to &quot;reinforced fossil fuel lock-in&quot;, by perpetuating a fossil fuel based energy provision system. Due to large-scale investments in CCS infrastructure, the fossil fuel based 'regime' would be perpetuated to at least the end of this century. In this paper we investigate if and how CCS could help to avoid reinforcing fossil fuel lock-in. First we develop a set of criteria to estimate the degree of technological lock-in. We apply these criteria to assess the lock-in reinforcement effect of adding CCS to the fossil fuel socio-technical regime (FFR). In principle, carbon dioxide could be captured from any carbon dioxide point source. In the practice of present technological innovations, business strategies, and policy developments, CCS is most often coupled to coal power plants. However, there are many point sources of carbon dioxide that are not directly related to coal or even fossil fuels. For instance, many forms of bio-energy or biomass-based processes generate significant streams of carbon dioxide emissions. Capturing this carbon dioxide which was originally sequestered in biomass could lead to negative carbon dioxide emissions. We use the functional approach of technical innovations systems (TIS) to estimate in more detail the strengths of the &quot;niches&quot; CCS and Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS). We also assess the orientation of the CCS niche towards the FFR and the risk of crowding out BECCS. Next we develop pathways for developing fossil energy carbon capture and storage, BECCS, and combinations of them, using transition pathways concepts. The outcome is that a large-scale BECCS development could be feasible under certain conditions, thus largely avoiding the risk of reinforced fossil fuel lock-in. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The different innovation capabilities of a firm are regarded as the key components of the firm's innovation system. The sources of information available within an RIS include external sources (EXT) and external expert organizations, the latter of which are referred to as knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). This study also explores the dual role of KIBS as both sources of and bridges for innovation in the RIS. Data were obtained through a mailed survey using a self-administered questionnaire. The utilization concept and the dual role of KIBS were verified. The results show that externally available information affects all innovation capabilities of the firm, while external expert organizations affect only the firm's R&amp;D and resources allocation capabilities. This study contributes to the RIS literature by providing empirical evidence on how firms can interact with the RIS by utilizing SI to enhance their TICs and achieve global competitiveness.

Therefore, mobile network operators should play a central role in the ecosystem by managing the entire value-chain and setting up proper value-sharing mechanisms.

    <att name="Z9" value="1" />
    <att name="AB" value="Background: This paper describes and analyses Rwanda's science-based health product 'innovation system', highlighting examples of indigenous innovation and good practice. We use an innovation systems framework, which takes into account the wide variety of stakeholders and knowledge flows contributing to the innovation process. The study takes into account the destruction of the country's scientific infrastructure and human capital that occurred during the 1994 genocide, and describes government policy, research institutes and universities, the private sector, and NGOs that are involved in health product innovation in Rwanda. Methods: Case study research methodology was used. Data were collected through reviews of academic literature and policy documents and through open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 38 people from across the science-based health innovation system. Data was collected over two visits to Rwanda between November - December 2007 and in May 2008. A workshop was held in Kigali on May 23rd and May 24th 2009 to validate the findings. A business plan was then developed to operationalize the findings. Results and discussion: The results of the study show that Rwanda has strong government will to support health innovation both through its political leadership and through government policy documents. However, it has a very weak scientific base as most of its scientific infrastructure as well as human capital were destroyed during the 1994 genocide. The regulatory agency is weak and its nascent private sector is ill-equipped to drive health innovation. In addition, there are no linkages between the various actors in the country's health innovation system i.e between research institutions, universities, the private sector, and government bureaucrats. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the 1994 genocide destroyed most of the scientific infrastructure and human capital, the country has made remarkable progress towards developing its health innovation system, mainly due to political goodwill. The areas of greatest potential for Rwanda are in traditional plant technologies. However, there is need for investments in domestic skill development as well as infrastructure that will enhance innovation. Of foremost importance is the establishment of a platform to link the various actors in the health innovation system." />

This paper assesses the effectiveness of the South Korean technopark. Technoparks on average had a higher number of tenants, tenant employees, and tenant firm sales compared to those of the other business incubators in Korea. Although the survival rate was relatively high in technoparks compared to that of the other business incubators, some of the technoparks were not effective at encouraging tenants to graduate from the incubator in a timely manner. The support program provided by the technopark format enables firms to easily access innovation resources and to reduce the costs of doing business. The incubator reduces the operating costs of tenant firms by providing facilities and shared services at low cost as well as aiding in market expansion. Moreover, the incubator provides tenant firms with research and development support, which results in the enhancement of innovation capability. Nonetheless, the strategies of the technopark and local government have not been sufficiently thorough in encouraging the incubated firms to settle in the same jurisdiction, in order to promote regional economic growth and to stimulate a continuous regional innovation system. We explored the organizational performance of the technopark and ascertained the relationship between the organizational effectiveness and the performance outcome. Local government and the technopark should coown the objectives and connect their support systems, to lead the firms incubated in a technopark to settle and grow successfully in the local region. This examination of working technoparks in South Korea will contribute to the development of strategies for creating science parks in other developing countries." />

    <att name="AB" value="This article draws on the theory of conventions and the concept of worlds of production for an interpretation of the transformations of a regional production system over several decades. Wine production in the Spanish region of Castile and Leon has shifted from a world of local and interpersonal production (prevailing before 1960) to the current preferred orientation towards quality markets, having passed through an intermediate phase (1960-1980) of table and bulk wines industrial production. Recently, indications have appeared of a return to an interpersonal and neo-artisanal production on the part of prestigious winemakers who distribute their wines to selected international clients. This path is the result of a gradual modification of the dominant conventions of the business, which has experienced a spectacular development in Castile and Leon, whose wines are now appreciated in many foreign markets. This evolution of conventions may be interpreted as an innovative process maintained to challenge the trends and demands of the market. But this argument does not explain how conventions change and how these changes spread along the production chain. Therefore, this article discusses the contribution of three factors to this shift across different worlds of wine production: organization of the production chain: regulations regarding the protection of food differentiated according to its geographic origin: and the setting up of a regional innovation system which supports the wine sector.

    <att name="AB" value="The success of an innovating firm often depends on the efforts of other innovators in its environment. How do the challenges faced by external innovators affect the focal firm's outcomes? To address this question we first characterize the external environment according to the structure Of interdependence. We follow the flow of inputs and outputs in the ecosystem to distinguish between upstream components that tire handled by the focal firm, and downstream complements that are bundled by the firm's customers. We hypothesize that the effects of external innovation challenges depend not only on their magnitude, but also 017 their location in the ecosystem relative to the focal firm. We identify a key asymmetry that results from the location of challenges relative to a focal firm-greater upstream innovation challenges in components enhance the benefits that accrue to technology leaders, while greater downstream innovation challenges in complements erode these benefits. We,further propose that the effectiveness of vertical integration as a strategy to manage ecosystem interdependence increases over the course of the technology life cycle. Me explore these arguments in the context of the global semiconductor lithography equipment industry from its emergence in 1962 to 2005 across nine distinct technology generations. We find strong empirical support for our framework. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd." />

    <att name="AB" value="The relationship between knowledge investments, innovation and competitiveness is an important topic in both academic research and economic policy and has been studied extensively over the past decades. Nowadays, investments in private and public R&amp;D are believed to make up the heart of a modem knowledge economy. The present paper adopts an evolutionary economics perspective and investigates whether, in addition to private R&amp;D activities, also institutional support systems and policy interventions play a role in inducing innovation initiatives and creating impacts on the performance and competitiveness of industries. We aim to find support for the hypothesis that the competitiveness of industries in the international arena is sustained by the dynamic interaction between national, regional and sectoral innovation systems. This may provide stakeholders with a better understanding of the context in which they operate. Since according to the evolutionary metaphor, the growth of an innovation system follows complex dynamics that cannot simply be analysed within a static quantitative equilibrium framework, we use here an alternative approach based on qualitative pattern recognition analysis originating from artificial intelligence analysis. Besides R&amp;D expenditures, human capital expenditures are regarded as the major input in the knowledge creation process in our analytical framework To this end, in our paper a qualitative causal model that maps out conditional relations between key factors in national innovation systems will be described. The focus of our investigation is on systematic patterns in the competitiveness of the EU Member States, using statistical information on innovation input and output data from the European Innovation Scoreboard. In our analysis we find support for the hypothesis that there are indeed significant interactions between distinct institutional levels, which may provide guidance to the strategic orientation of nations and the European Union in terms of the emphasis on competitiveness vis-A-vis cohesion.

It identifies and characterizes different types of enterprises engaged in the biopharmaceutical sector in terms of their business organisation and regional set up. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data compilations not yet employed in academic analysis as well as personal interviews in China, structural determinants and driving forces of development are analysed against the background of the innovation systems literature. Findings - The geography of innovation in China's biopharmaceutical industry is determined by both, government policy and the strategic location decisions of entrepreneurs. While local-government support of firm clustering has contributed to a dispersion of industrial activity throughout China, the firms&quot; networks are spanning clusters. Effectively, domestic firms are turning into multi-regional companies locating activities such as R&amp;D and manufacturing at different clusters. Originality/value - The paper adds to the literature in so far as it throws light on an until now under-researched field of China's innovation system. It identifies the concept of multi-regionalism among domestic non-state enterprises as an important parameter for understanding success and regional distribution of the industry." />

    <att name="AB" value="Most firms competing in the global economy are paying increasing attention to innovation as the key driver of competitiveness. Innovation's key dimensions address the quality, the quantity and the speed of introducing innovations. With an increasing rate of change in the global economy, especially after the onset of the 2008-2009 economic crisis, innovation management emerges as a powerful way to facilitate a firm's adaptation to new conditions. However, despite a widespread acceptance of innovation's importance by the leadership of most companies, there is a general dissatisfaction with the results realised from innovation investments. For any organisation to address effectively the innovation challenge, its leadership must properly define the innovation system and process and apply sound quality and innovation management principles, as was done in the development of quality management and finance management. This requires the periodic assessment not only of innovation outputs, i.e. new products, services or business models, but also of inputs that determine a firm's innovation capability and the innovation process itself. Managing the effectiveness of the innovation process requires a balanced set of innovation metrics related to all innovation drivers, i.e. leadership, culture and people participation together with innovation results, such as time to market and financial metrics. This paper describes an integrated framework for the systematic assessment of an organisation's quality, i.e. value-generating capability of its innovation management and the timely identification of ways to measure and improve it." />

The concept allows for a better understanding of the complex driving forces and mechanisms that mediate the conditions, the extent and the outcomes of innovative behaviour. However, the ideas behind 'national', 'regional' and 'sectoral' innovation systems remain to be tested in tourism. With environmental protection and tourism development as objectives, the Sea Trout Funen initiative started in 1989 as a collaboration between the county council, the Anglers' Association, tourism businesses and a hatching plant. The activities merit the label 'tourism innovation system', first, because there are stable relations between a large number of actors from the public, voluntary and business sectors with intermittent links to educational institutions. Secondly, the relationship has proven to be mutually beneficial and synergetic. Thirdly, examples are found of consequential innovations in terms of products and services for tourists, in terms of environmental protection and development methods and in terms of the development of human resources. Fourthly, the innovation system has been able to benefit distinctly and positively from external opportunities, such as new regulations." />

The study of nanotechnology offers a lens to examine China's capabilities to move closer to the frontier of technology-led economic development, explore the evolving Chinese innovation system, and assess the effectiveness of policy strategies to modernize and add-value to research and industry in China. Supported by new policy initiatives and funding, hundreds of institutions and thousands of researchers in China are engaged in nanotechnology R&amp;D. Yet, although Chinese nanotechnology research has scale, the pathways from laboratory research to successful commercialization remain problematic. Chinese performance in nanotechnology patenting and product development is weak relative to its research strength, suggesting a significant gap between the research base and industrial development. Drawing on bibliometric research and field interviews with Chinese nanotechnology policymakers, researchers and business representatives, we analyze this gap, explore the factors contributing to it and assess future commercialization trajectories.

    <att name="AB" value="In this paper we use scale-independent indicators to explore the performance of the Chinese innovation system from an economic and from a science and technology point of view, and compare it with 21 other nations. Some important developments in the Chinese innovation system, hidden by rankings by conventional performance indicators, were revealed. We find that gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) &amp; gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP &amp; POP (population) all exhibit strong 'Matthew effects', measured by their scaling factors. This means that the Chinese R&amp;D intensity (GERD/GDP) and national wealth (GDP per capita) are growing significantly with the increase of the GDP. Also pairs such as citations &amp; papers, papers &amp; GDP, citations &amp; GDP, and paper &amp; GERD exhibit these 'Matthew effects'. This observation points to the fact that in China scientific outputs and impacts are growing faster than economic growth and research investment. However, according to another scale-independent indicator, namely the adjusted relative citation impact (ARCI), China ranks on the bottom of the list, but the growth rate of the ARCI is the highest among these countries (comparing the periods 1995-1999 and 2001-2005). To sum up, we interpret these findings to mean that the scientific outputs and impacts of China show a real tendency of catching up with its economic growth. It is expected that with an increase of its GDP and R&amp;D intensity China will show a sustained increase in indicators related to science and technology. Similarly, there are very strong 'Matthew effects' between the outputs of technology (patents) and economic growth and research investment. This means that the outputs of technology are expected to increase considerably with an increase of GDP and R&amp;D expenditure. Furthermore, in the Chinese innovation system the government intramural expenditure on R&amp;D (GOVERD) has a stronger non-linear impact on patent productivity than business enterprise expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD). This shows that in China research institutions financed by the government play a more important role than enterprises. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

We define COI as environments that favor the creation and development of high potential entrepreneurial ventures. COI are characterized by heightened mobility of resources (principally people, capital, and information-including intellectual property); increased velocity of business development; and a culture of mobility that leads to an affinity for collaboration, development of durable relationships, and the formation of Networks of Clusters of Innovation (NCOI). These networks are distinct sets of relationships. When the connections progress to the point of mutual dependence and business integration among participating enterprises, such covalent bonds form tightly interrelated business communities, or Super-Clusters of Innovation (Super-COI). In this article, we analyze the characteristics of COI and the nature of the relationships that arise between them to form NCOI and Super-COI.

These multi-directional coupling elements in innovation ecology co-evolve to achieve collective interests and excellence, which in turn may stimulate technological development and social change. Important processes/mechanisms, including a policy kit and action, strategic networking, supportive associations, knowledge and intellectual capital management, among others, are discussed.

Empirically the paper studies the emergence and development of new firms derived in various forms from a downsizing lead pharmaceutical firm (Pharmacia). A model is developed conceptualizing RCC of regions by the levels of business creation obtained at different levels of asset complexity for given levels of decomposition of available resources. RCC of Pharmacia's home region (Stockholm-Uppsala) is characterized by mapping all 75 new firms derived from Pharmacia onto the RCC space, revealing low RCC particularly for resources released from Pharmacia in highly decomposed form. Recombinations whereby managers from Pharmacia and other related incumbents become founders of new bio drug discovery firms (DDFs) come out as particularly scarce when benchmarked against the simultaneous emergence of a DDF sector in the otherwise comparable Copenhagen region. Venture capital is argued to be a key mechanism in RCC affecting high-tech entrepreneurship. We test and confirm that compared to their Copenhagen counterpart, DDFs in the Stockholm-Uppsala region received much less early stage venture financing which therefore provided notable disincentives for re-combinatorial manager-to-founder transitions." />

The business sector, the science sector, and policy actors are involved in this process as has been stressed in concepts such as innovation systems and the network approach. It is still unclear, however, as to what extent different kinds of innovation rely oil specific knowledge Sources and links. More advanced innovations oil the one hand might draw more oil scientific knowledge, generated in universities and research organizations. Such knowledge is often exchanged in personal interactions at a local or regional level. Incremental innovations and the adoption of new technologies, on the other hand, seem to occur often in interaction with partners from the business sector also at higher spatial levels. In this paper, we analyze such patterns of knowledge links. After dealing with knowledge interactions from a conceptual view and reviewing the relevant literature, we present an empirical analysis for Austria. The findings show that firms introducing more advanced innovations are relying to a higher extent oil R&amp;D and patents, and that they are cooperating more often with universities and research organizations. Firms having introduced less advanced innovations rely more on knowledge links with business services. Furthermore, the employment of researchers was identified as a key factor enhancing knowledge interactions of firms with universities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 25 (5), 655-670; Chaminade, C., Vang, J., 2006a. Innovation policy for small and medium size SMEs in Asia: an innovation systems perspective. In: Yeung, H. (Ed.), Handbook of Research on Asian Business. Edward Elgar. Cheltenham; Maggi, C., 2007. The salmon farming and processing cluster in Southern Chile. In: Pietrobello, C., Rabellotti, R. (Eds.), Upgrading and Governance in Clusters and Value Chains in Latin America. Harvard University Press). A specialized hub refers to a node in a global value chain that mainly undertakes one or a few of the activities required for the production and development of a given good or service or serves a particular segment of the global market. In global value chains, firms in developing countries have traditionally been responsible for the lowest added-value activities. However, a few emerging regional innovation systems in developing countries are beginning to challenge this scenario by rapidly upgrading in the value chain. There is, however, still only a poorly developed understanding of how the system of innovation emerges and evolves to support this transition process and what the role of regional innovation policy is in building the regional conditions that support indigenous small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in this transition process. This paper aims at reducing this omission by analyzing the co-evolution of the strategies of indigenous SMEs and the regional innovation system of Bangalore (India). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    <att name="AB" value="In contrast to the US and recently Europe, Japan appears to be unsuccessful in establishing new industries. An oft-cited example is Japan's practical invisibility in the global business software sector. Literature has ascribed Japan's weakness - or conversely, America's strength - to the specific institutional settings and competences of actors within the respective national innovation system. it has additionally been argued that unlike the American innovation system, with its proven ability to give birth to new industries, the inherent path dependency of the Japanese innovation system makes innovation and establishment of new industries quite difficult. However, there are two notable weaknesses underlying current propositions postulating that only certain innovation systems enable the creation of new industries: first, they mistakenly confound context specific with general empirical observations. And second, they grossly underestimate - or altogether fail to examine - the dynamics within innovation systems. This paper will show that it is precisely the dynamics within innovation systems - dynamics founded on the concept of path plasticity - which have enabled Japan to charge forward as a global leader in a highly innovative field: the game software sector.

This paper focuses on the European perspective, i.e. it discusses current challenges Europe faces vis-a-vis trends in industrial R&amp;D, but the findings and arguments are more general ones. It argues that our perspective on internationalization is still shaped too much by a zero sum-rationale, whereby one location wins R&amp;D capacity that another location loses. It develops a cost-benefit matrix in order to capture the overall costs and benefits of international R&amp;D activities more broadly. The paper argues that more creativity is needed, that our perspective needs to be broadened to tackle all variables conditioning international activities in R&amp;D ( including local conditions of demand and discourse) and to stress the importance of the absorption of global knowledge by as many actors within an innovation system as possible. On the basis of recent survey data the paper furthermore concludes that public research should be thought of as a trans-national transmission belt of knowledge and as the prime factor that shapes the attractiveness and effectiveness of a location for business R&amp;D. Finally, it is argued that policy schemes geared towards international R&amp;D need to accept and tackle the issue of co-ordination of governance and to take advantage of the flexible possibilities offered at the European level, beyond the logic of the European Framework Programme." />

The experiences of Malaysia and Thailand provide additional empirical support for some of the propositions raised by scholars who have studied NIS dynamics. The key insights generated are as follows: (1) Visionary leadership is critical in developing a country's NIS; (2) Innovation policy must be linked to the overall economic and development goals of the country, and must be adequately supported by targeted programs; (3) Focusing on a few sectors serves to concentrate scarce resources on the priority areas; (4) Integrating efforts through a coordinating body enhances the ability of the government to mobilize limited resources by reducing activities that duplicate each other, but could also worsen bureaucratic red tape; and (5) Government programs and policy instruments must be designed to fit the requirements of firms that face a variety of constraints and have different motives for undertaking innovation." />

These questions are addressed through a case study of detailed processes enabling the shift of technology to new domains of application. An innovative IT firm developed its own semiconductor technology to remedy supplier deficiencies but it required a joint venture with a completely new business model to adapt and move the technology into new market domains. We propose the concept of techno-organizational speciation to delineate this phenomenon. Competing perspectives on speciation (compatibility, niche and lineage approaches) are found to illuminate the evidence, while complementarities between these conceptual dimensions are revealed by the case. Causal processes uncovered include the following: (1) Techno-organizational speciation through spin-off may be needed to launch a dominant technical standard, compatible with multiple applications. (2) This can be achieved through niche creation from which develops a new business ecosystem. (3) Inherited knowledge together with organizationally based learning foster the branching and renewal of technological lineages. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." />

The results demonstrate that TSS actually serve as technology bridges along the stages of the technology-intensive industry's life cycle, connecting sources of technical knowledge (e.g. universities) with recipient organisations (e.g. large private companies), that use the transferred technology to innovate their products or services. The major achievement is that TSS do not play just a brokering function; they perform on the acquired technology value-added activities (i.e. personalisation or recombination) the recipient organisations are willing to pay for, thus ensuring the sustainability of the TSS firm business model." />

    <att name="AB" value="Incubators have become a ubiquitous phenomenon in many parts of the world and are viewed as a tool for promoting the development of technology-based growth firms. Considering the large faith and the considerable amounts of money invested in incubators, the identification of best practice incubator models is of importance. Previous incubator assessment literature has tended to emphasise the measurement of incubator outcomes. In this paper, we argue that best practice identification requires a holistic approach, where the goals of the incubators are taken into account and the performance of different incubators are put in relation to their incubator models. In this context, the aim of this paper is to develop a framework that can serve as a basis for identifying best practice incubator models and for more rigorous evaluations of incubator performance. The framework suggested includes three distinguishing model components: selection, business support and mediation. We distinguish between idea-focused selection and entrepreneur-focused selection as well as between &quot;picking-the-winners&quot; and &quot;survival-of-the-fittest&quot; selection. Business support is seen as a continuum from &quot;laissez-faire&quot; to &quot;strong intervention&quot;. Mediation strategies vary in terms of the type of innovation system in focus: technological, regional or cluster. The framework is applied to 16 Swedish incubators. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These roles are components, products and applications, and support and infrastructure. Technologies within an ecosystem interact through these roles and impact each others' evolution. We also classify types of interactions between technology roles, which we term paths of influence.

This approach has been adopted as an analytical framework and guideline for science policy making by numerous public sector organizations around the world. Using a case study of the Canadian and Quebec public sectors, our research seeks to understand why the IS approach has gained the adherence of government employees and how it has been disseminated from international organizations down to regional civil servants. Findings show that adherence to the IS approach stems from the prestige of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its associated epistemic community, and from the cultural authority science exerts on government employees; these two factors bestow cultural authority onto the IS approach. The perceived scientific validity of the IS approach also leads government employees to consider its underlying economistic worldview as an unquestionable reality." />

We place the creation and subsequent evolution of ARD within its historical context and show how it was an innovation by Boston-area civic elites. Using new historical data, we examine the evolution of ARD's practices over time. We argue that ARD's funding model constrained its functioning as a venture capital firm and contributed to its demise. ARD was a pioneering organization whose business model ultimately failed as a newer organizational model, the limited partnership, was created and had a better fit with the business environment.

The paper highlights the business incubation system as an aspect of the triple helix model of innovation in which universities, industry, government and non-government organizations feature as principal actors in the national innovation system. The paper notes the need for both technology transfer and the development of the triple helix culture in developing countries. It also underlines the need for policy in developing countries to ensure that the former played only a residual role, while the latter took the lead in providing for the development of a culture of innovation. The culture of bureaucracy and institutional fragmentation has been a major factor militating against initiatives for technological capability development; and the conventional technology transfer practice has reinforced this culture. A major policy initiative is needed in developing countries to put the national system of innovation in place and remove the constraints on the development of the triple helix culture." />

An important conclusion is that the work (and apparent success) of the project is consistent with an understanding of development that emphasizes the importance of innovation systems. It is also an example of the importance of continuous learning and of institutional change. In contrast to much conventional development aid, it is an interesting example of how projects can actually lead to long-term sustainable changes that survive the withdrawal of the donor, having built capacity that truly means self-sufficiency. It is therefore an approach that deserves careful consideration on the part of all participants in international development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="AB" value="The title embodies the belief, expressed in 2000 by Northern Ireland's Economic Development Minister, Sir Reg Empey, that innovation is the 'golden thread' that must run through its economy and policy for the hitherto troubled part of the UK to recover its historic economic dynamism. The paper reports a study of Northern Ireland's innovation performance in light of comparative data and through the lens of the regional innovation systems approach to analysis and strategy. It is shown that business expenditure on innovation inputs like R&amp;D has risen, but that a long ' tail' of innovation under-achievers remains evident. Three categories of firm are shown to be innovative and these are swiftly developing systemic interaction with a support infrastructure led by venture capital that is agile in meeting growth requirements of indigenous innovators, thereby setting a standard that public support agencies are being urged to emulate in a new strategic approach to regional innovation." />

    <att name="AB" value="Although the inventions embodied in the Internet originated in a diverse set of industrial economies, the US was consistently the source of critical innovations and an early adopter of new applications. Why did other nations, including several that made important inventive contributions to the Internet, not play a larger role in its development, particularly in the creation of new business organizations, governance institutions, and applications? We argue that the role of the US &quot;national innovation system&quot; in the creation of the Internet echoes several key themes of US technological development before 1940. The presence of a large domestic market, a set of antitrust and regulatory policies that weakened the power of incumbent telecommunications firms, and a diverse private/public research community that was willing to work with both domestic and foreign inventions were important preconditions for US leadership in computer networking innovation.

    <att name="AB" value="Socio-economic research on biotechnology is dealing mainly with the sectors of biopharmaceuticals, agro-food or environmental technologies. In contrast, the equipment and supplies sector seems to be largely ignored. This is surprising because this sector provides important input in terms of technology and material for the development of biotechnology in general. Our comparative analysis of the sector in eight countries indicates that there exists no specific science base for the sector and that it is largely neglected by public research funding. Commercial activities are concentrated in countries with a large general science base in biotechnology and strong multinational pharmaceutical or chemical companies. There is a rather broad diversity in the way the sector has developed in the eight countries. Our data support the notion that national peculiarities seem dominant for explaining this picture. We anticipate growing business opportunities for European firms to step into large markets of equipment and supplies for functional genomics and protein analyses where Europe maintains a strong science base.

These weaknesses could partly be overcome by their integration into networks and innovation systems. Due to the fact that interactions of SMEs are often informal and trust based, the region should be an important interaction and support-space for the innovation activities of SMEs. According to the empirical findings of a European TSER project (SMEPOL) this was not fully confirmed: SMEs are less often engaged in innovation networks than larger firms and if they have innovation partnerships they are primarily concentrated on business partners. Because relations to science and technology transfer are rare, SMEs make only limited use of the full potential of their respective regional innovation systems." />

Spatial proximity is obviously of particular importance for horizontal co-operation and for relationships to publicly funded research institutions.

This contention is supported by a statistical analysis using data from a research project on innovation systems in several European regions. The results demonstrate that partners from science are more important than the firms' customers for the introduction of products which are new to the market. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    <att name="AB" value="Our paper summarizes some of the main results of the European Regional Innovation Survey (ERIS) as far as they are discussed in this special issue of European Planning Studies. The overall target of the ERIS project is a quantitative and qualitative assessment of determinants crucial for the innovation potential of any region, i.e. innovative and non-innovative manufacturing firms, business services and research institutions, as well as the innovative linkages and networks between these actors. Empirical research is based upon almost 8600 questionnaires collected in II European regions. Results confirm some of the common hypotheses on the relationship between space and innovation networks but others are contrary to existing scientific knowledge. Obviously the impact of national innovation systems an the innovation activities of manufacturing firms in a given European region is-at least-as strong as the impact of the respective regional innovation system. The spatial range of innovative linkages significantly depends an the size, the type of the cooperation partner, the R&amp;D intensity and the industry of the analysed manufacturing firm. For example, the higher the technology intensity of the industry, the greater is the need of each firm to use intraregional knowledge via innovation linkages. It is therefore an important task in regional innovation Policy to promote network-building among firms and other actors of a regional innovation system and to interlink these intraregional networks with national and international knowledge sources." />

    <att name="AB" value="The German business system has been regarded as a particularly tightly coupled system, with embeddedness of even multinational companies (MNCs) in their home base as particularly deep. A study of the impact of companies' changing internationalization, if not globalization, strategies is therefore especially suited to test competing claims about their effects on the German business system. Are we experiencing an erosion of this system, an adaptation in a largely path-dependent way, or even a greater specialization and stronger crystallization of the German business system? To investigate these questions, the paper examines a small number of German MNCs in their domestic and international context. More particularly, the work focuses on whether and how their emergent globalization activities affect the reproduction or erosion of the three institutional complexes which shape the factors of production: the financial system; the innovation system; and the industrial relations system. The paper concludes that a new type of transformation hybridization - is emerging. It is regarded as a consequence of German companies' growing integration into a global economic system." />

An additional task, specific for a transition country, is intensive utilization of the inherited human capital. The results of a business survey conducted in Tallinn in the summer of 1996 indicate that favourable restructuring of industrial R&amp;D and the development of new innovation capacities are indeed taking place. The regression models indicate, however, that while the results seem to be mostly successful, some detailed support is needed. Firstly, further qualitative changes seem to be necessary in the state-owned and privatized electronics firms. And secondly, newly emerging firms need easier access to the capital market and management expertise." />

The model, which describes the system from the perspective of the firm or enterprise, has the following properties: (a) it is flexible in its application but symmetrical in structure, making it easier to generalize or specialize; (b) it is simple, which helps makers and implementers of policy to visualize their role in the system; and (c) it is quantifiable, which aids comparisons among firms and among different systems of innovation. We make some applications of the new model, and show how other frameworks can be mapped onto it, Tn particular, we show the relationship with the European Community's model Innovation Survey and based on that, make some comments on future directions for survey instruments.
