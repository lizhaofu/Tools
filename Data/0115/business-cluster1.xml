    <att name="AB" value="Transfer of low carbon technologies to developing countries has been recognized as important in global efforts to limit climate change. Yet the mechanics of international technology transfer, especially around intellectual property rights, have remained a controversial issue in international negotiations. Using a new dataset on international partnerships in China and India in three key low carbon technologies solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and coal gasification/integrated gasification combined cycle and complementary expert interviews we study the dynamics of the transfer of intellectual property and the underlying drivers that guide the development of business strategies and partnerships in the context of transitioning intellectual property regimes in emerging markets. We find that weak intellectual property regimes are indeed a hindrance to the diffusion of certain classes of low carbon technologies: (i) for cutting-edge technologies, (ii) for fully-embodied (explicitly codified) technologies, and (iii) for small firms. However, we also find that intellectual property issues do not represent a barrier to the diffusion of the relatively mature and low to medium cost low carbon technologies that are materially (at scale) most important for carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the short to medium term. Competitive technology supply, shifting market dynamics, and increasingly vigorous domestic innovation coupled with mechanisms and opportunities to structure credible intellectual property deals allow for the diffusion of key low carbon technologies to occur within the context of existing business, political, and institutional structures.

    <att name="AB" value="The Korean innovation system is analyzed based on patenting and co-patenting behavior between different knowledge producers (university, government, small- and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), conglomerates, individuals) in 34 different technologies. Patent data is obtained from the Korean Intellectual Property Office for the years 2001-2010. The traditional Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations is expanded to include additional knowledge producers. The results indicate that the Korean innovation system has become less balanced in terms of technology: patent output has tended to grow rapidly in areas in which Korea is already strong. But the innovation system has become more balanced in terms of knowledge producers: SMEs, universities and individuals are being assigned an increasing number of patents. University patenting has grown most rapidly, especially in fast-growing technologies, in which university-business co-patenting is most prevalent. This suggests that rising public investment in university research is paying off, and that university research is industry-relevant. The data also reveal some unexpected changes: patenting by conglomerates rapidly rose from 2001, peaking in 2005, and then fell. Patenting by individuals has continued to rise throughout the period being studied."/>

    <att name="AB" value="It is commonly accepted nowadays that innovations are brought forward in all interactive process of knowledge generation and application. The business sector, the science sector, and policy actors are involved in this process as has been stressed in concepts such as innovation systems and the network approach. It is still unclear, however, as to what extent different kinds of innovation rely oil specific knowledge Sources and links. More advanced innovations oil the one hand might draw more oil scientific knowledge, generated in universities and research organizations. Such knowledge is often exchanged in personal interactions at a local or regional level. Incremental innovations and the adoption of new technologies, on the other hand, seem to occur often in interaction with partners from the business sector also at higher spatial levels. In this paper, we analyze such patterns of knowledge links. After dealing with knowledge interactions from a conceptual view and reviewing the relevant literature, we present an empirical analysis for Austria. The findings show that firms introducing more advanced innovations are relying to a higher extent oil R&amp;D and patents, and that they are cooperating more often with universities and research organizations. Firms having introduced less advanced innovations rely more on knowledge links with business services. Furthermore, the employment of researchers was identified as a key factor enhancing knowledge interactions of firms with universities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore patterns as well as determinants of regional specialisation in China&apos;s biopharmaceutical industry. It identifies and characterizes different types of enterprises engaged in the biopharmaceutical sector in terms of their business organisation and regional set up. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data compilations not yet employed in academic analysis as well as personal interviews in China, structural determinants and driving forces of development are analysed against the background of the innovation systems literature. Findings - The geography of innovation in China&apos;s biopharmaceutical industry is determined by both, government policy and the strategic location decisions of entrepreneurs. While local-government support of firm clustering has contributed to a dispersion of industrial activity throughout China, the firms&quot; networks are spanning clusters. Effectively, domestic firms are turning into multi-regional companies locating activities such as R&amp;D and manufacturing at different clusters. Originality/value - The paper adds to the literature in so far as it throws light on an until now under-researched field of China&apos;s innovation system. It identifies the concept of multi-regionalism among domestic non-state enterprises as an important parameter for understanding success and regional distribution of the industry."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to collate relevant literature on the theoretical background of regional innovation systems and factors that impact the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems. Design/methodology/approach - The collated information is then used to determine the opinions of experts from industries within science-based parks, and the scholars on the researches of regional innovation systems in Taiwan. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to evaluate the critical factors of regional innovation systems. Findings - This study finds that industry cluster effects constitute the most significant operating factor for regional innovation systems within the Taiwanese science-based parks. In addition, this study not only confirms that partners or parent firm location which were advocated by Todtling et al. are also critical to Taiwanese regional innovation systems, but also verifies how well the relationships to partners or parent firm are equally important for expansion the regional innovation systems. Research limitations/implications - The concepts of regional innovation system have been established since 1990, and related articles have been published from European and Asian scholars, however, seldom does literature offer questionnaires or research items to measure the operational effectiveness of a regional innovation system. Therefore this study has developed a questionnaire, by reviewing literature and verifying it by the AHP method, with Taiwan&apos;s HsinChu Science Park as the subject case. For the contribution on theories, this study inducted the construction of new innovation environments, new interactional behavior in regional organization innovation, and injection of new resources into regional innovation as the three main constructs to influence the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems. In addition, this study has used experts&apos; questionnaire answers and the AHP method to clarify the priority of factors to operate the regional innovation system. Practical implications - Industry cluster effect, construction of knowledge infrastructure and how close partners or parent firm are (distance and relationship) are the top three factors in HsinChu Science Park. The duties of the government are not merely picking good firms for the regional innovation system, but also making policies and defining regimes, providing a good business environment for campus firms, universities, and research institutions, as well as offering plenty of R&amp;D funding to encourage industry-academia cooperation. Governments must invest in infrastructures, such as: establishing databases, libraries, information networks, the national technical standards for certification, and other public services, to facilitate industry-academia cooperation. Social implications - These research results indicate the operating essentials of regional innovation systems are not limited to interactions among regional organizations. This study suggests that the success or failure of a new regional innovation system would instead, be dependent on the regional environment, as in software planning and support, as well as the relationship of innovation with policy implementation and administration. Originality/value - Results showed that the top-five factors influencing the operational effectiveness of regional innovation systems are the industry cluster effect, the construction of knowledge infrastructure, how close to partner&apos;s or parent&apos;s firm (distance and relationship), import of foreign capital and technology, and the implementation of regional innovation policy."/>

The system of innovation is the context for a process of innovation that can be described in terms of the knowledge sources and flows that lead to commercial advances, In this paper, we develop a model of the innovation process and of the system of innovation in which it takes place. The model, which describes the system from the perspective of the firm or enterprise, has the following properties: (a) it is flexible in its application but symmetrical in structure, making it easier to generalize or specialize; (b) it is simple, which helps makers and implementers of policy to visualize their role in the system; and (c) it is quantifiable, which aids comparisons among firms and among different systems of innovation. We make some applications of the new model, and show how other frameworks can be mapped onto it, Tn particular, we show the relationship with the European Community&apos;s model Innovation Survey and based on that, make some comments on future directions for survey instruments.

Incubation not only provides a diversified and integrated service for entrepreneurial ventures but also contributes upward to regional and national innovation and economic growth. Building upon the logic of co-evolution theory, this paper argues that incubation acts at the meso-level as a critical interface between macro-innovation systems and micro-business ventures. These multi-directional coupling elements in innovation ecology co-evolve to achieve collective interests and excellence, which in turn may stimulate technological development and social change. Important processes/mechanisms, including a policy kit and action, strategic networking, supportive associations, knowledge and intellectual capital management, among others, are discussed.

Our analysis reveals that the JP NIS is at an advantage in an industry where consumer demand changes rapidly and incremental innovation is crucial. In contrast, the U.S. NIS benefits an industry where frequent radical innovation is required. Furthermore, we show that heavy reliance on in-house R&amp;D is advantageous over open-innovation practice in an industry where radical innovation is crucial when long-term business relationships are prominent. Based on the simulation results, we draw conclusions including strategic and policy implications for JP firms and policymakers, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Taiwan&apos;s machine tool industry is one of the few industries that do not depend on the support of foreign technologies. Nevertheless, it relies on the development of supplier networks among individual enterprises. This study clarifies the customer value creation mode of Taiwan&apos;s machine tool enterprises in a regional innovation system (RIS) by understanding the meaning of the value offered by suppliers to their customers and the dynamic development of value creation models across the boundaries of RIS. In this study, we use as dimensions the customer&apos;s perspective of value, the supplier-customer interaction, and particularly the customer involvement to derive the value creation theory. We propose four models of value creation, including a high degree of product standardization with standard recommendations to the customer; product customization with the customer entering into the supplier&apos;s process of achieving the customers&apos; preferences; customers and suppliers co-working in a mutual business process to co-create solutions; and the supplier developing a better understanding of customer needs to provide optional solutions. This study demonstrates that four types of value creation have been evidenced in Taiwan&apos;s machine tool industry from the viewpoint of the customer, and each type of value creation has its respective environmental and workable conditions. When accompanied by various RIS factors such as customer value creation, this not only develops dynamic growth but also, to a certain degree, affects the growth in competitiveness of the region and its companies. In a highly customizing, flexible, and demanding environment, enhancing customers&apos; value creation beyond their functional requirements while reducing the interaction costs associated with customization may be a challenge for a single enterprise; however, it may prove to present art opportunity to shift Taiwan&apos;s machine tools industry toward global competitiveness.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper is concerned with the changing role of regional innovation systems and regional policies in supporting the transition of indigenous firms in developing countries from competing on low costs towards becoming knowledge providers in global value chains. Special attention is paid to policies supporting the emergence and development of the regional innovation system in this transition process. Regional innovation systems in developing countries have very recently started to be conceptualised as specialized hubs in global innovation and production networks (Asheim, B., Coenen, L, Vang-Lauridsen, J., 2007. Face-to-face, buzz and knowledge bases: socio-spatial implications for learning, innovation and innovation policy.

In: Pietrobello, C., Rabellotti, R. (Eds.), Upgrading and Governance in Clusters and Value Chains in Latin America. Harvard University Press). A specialized hub refers to a node in a global value chain that mainly undertakes one or a few of the activities required for the production and development of a given good or service or serves a particular segment of the global market. In global value chains, firms in developing countries have traditionally been responsible for the lowest added-value activities. However, a few emerging regional innovation systems in developing countries are beginning to challenge this scenario by rapidly upgrading in the value chain. There is, however, still only a poorly developed understanding of how the system of innovation emerges and evolves to support this transition process and what the role of regional innovation policy is in building the regional conditions that support indigenous small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in this transition process. This paper aims at reducing this omission by analyzing the co-evolution of the strategies of indigenous SMEs and the regional innovation system of Bangalore (India). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    <att name="AB" value="In the century and half since its 1861 unification, Italy has left the periphery of the world economy and reached a level of wealth close to that of industrialized core Western countries. Since the 1990s, however, the process of globalization has exposed the weakness of the Italian productive system, and the country&apos;s economic performance has been one of the worst in the world. This pattern raises questions about the very nature of the Italian economy, its historical development, and its relative success in the long run, demonstrating the need for a structural reassessment of these themes. The aim of this special forum is to provide such analysis, offering a systematic and innovative view based on the interaction between institutions (conceived as the rules of the game of economic agents), firm structure, and economic performance. The main hypothesis discussed in all four articles is that Italian capitalism has been negatively affected by inefficient institutions that had a strong impact on firms&apos; size and governance, managerial practices, and attitude to innovate. As a result, the Italian economic performance has been frustrated, rather than promoted, by the institutional environment, and in large part shaped by fortunate contingencies. After the editors&apos; introduction, the special forum starts with a reconstruction of the macroeconomic scenario (Italy&apos;s Modern Economic Growth, 1861-2011), using the state-of-the-art data and focusing not only on the process of growth, but also on the problems of living standard, inequality, and regional disparities. The second article (Institutions, Politics, and the Corporate Economy) focuses on the exceptionality of the Italian industrial structure characterized by the large dominance of small firms. The authors explain how the institutional setting has played a crucial role in determining the contrasting performance of big business on the one hand, and of small firms on the other. The third article in the forum (The Ghost in the Attic? The Italian National Innovation System in Historical Perspective, 1861-2011), which provides a broad reconstruction of long-term trends in science and technology, analyzes the Italian innovative capabilities in the long run. The authors explain how the institutional setup has determined the Italian attitude toward technological innovation in the different historical phases, and suggest that the Italian national innovation system, from the unification until today, has been characterized by a peculiar shadowy or ghostly nature. The last article (Happy 150th Anniversary, Italy? Institutions and Economic Performance Since 1861), which also synthesizes the very message of the forum, focuses on the mechanisms on which institutions work. The authors argue that Italian economic development has been characterized in the long run by poor formal institutions, which led to a suboptimal pattern of growth characterized by scarce investment in education, low salaries, imitative technologies, and exploitative management of firms by owners who were mainly stockholders rather than stakeholders."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The growth in popularity of the regional innovation system approach has, in part, been driven by the need for economies to respond to the after shocks of the global financial crisis. At the same time, the author sees the term anchor institutions are used increasingly to describe organisations that have an important presence in the local community and make some strategic contribution to the local economy. The purpose of this paper is to consider the needs of the micro and small business (MSB) ecosystem through the lens of the entrepreneurial university as a regional anchor institution. Design/methodology/approach - Asheim et al. (2011) refers to regional innovation systems as, an emphasis on economic and social interaction between agents, spanning the public and private sectors to engender and diffuse innovation within regions embedded in wider national and global systems. According to Doloreux and Parto (2005) three dimensions underpin the use of the regional innovation systems concept, namely: the interactions between different actors in the innovation process, the role of institutions and the use of regional systems analysis to inform policy decisions. The author has drawn on contemporary literature on the entrepreneurial university, regional systems of innovation and institutions to explore some key qualities and problems around anchor Institutions, networks and national and local policy. Findings - Following the Chancellor&apos;s Comprehensive Spending Review in November 2015 and post the changes in the Department of Business Innovation and Skills remit the author wants to highlight the way universities can take a lead role as an anchor institution within their region. The author argues that this role should include providing a wider range of formal and informal support, knowledge and resource for MSBs, alongside the usual SME suspects (Hart and Anyadike-Danes, 2014; Witty, 2013; Wilson, 2012). Based on my analysis and involvement in the the work of the eight Entrepreneurial Universities of the Year Award winners - during the author&apos;s time as President of ISBE - He suggested four different ways in which collaboration might be enhanced to ensure MSBs make maximum use of the advice and support on offer from universities playing this anchor role. Originality/value - The results emerging from this work suggest a need for regional policy makers to embrace a innovation-supportive culture, which actually enables firms and systems to evolve over time would be far more effective than those proposed in the latest Comprehensive Spending Review. The outcomes of which will see some of the most robustly evaluated programmes, designed to support small firm growth, closed down and replaced by a commitment (by government) to secure a strong, growing economy, cutting of more red tape and extending small business rate relief for an extra year (Mole, 2015)."/>

Important insights into the differing nature of research and development (R&amp;D) collaboration in particular sectors have been provided by research inspired by the knowledge-base approach embedded within innovation system (IS) theory. This study aims to contribute to this body of literature by applying the concept of differentiated knowledge bases to the former state-socialist countries, where the IS operates through a firewall between academia and industry. Data on collaborative R&amp;D projects co-financed by public resources have allowed a detailed analysis of the nature of collaboration networks, revealing emerging patterns of academia-industry linkages and questioning the propositions stemming from the knowledge-based approach.

    <att name="AB" value="A new approach in science policy making named the innovation system (IS) approach has been developed during the past three decades. Its primary goal is to better understand the processes through which scientific knowledge is produced and transferred to businesses to improve their competitiveness and develop national and/or regional economies. This approach has been adopted as an analytical framework and guideline for science policy making by numerous public sector organizations around the world. Using a case study of the Canadian and Quebec public sectors, our research seeks to understand why the IS approach has gained the adherence of government employees and how it has been disseminated from international organizations down to regional civil servants. Findings show that adherence to the IS approach stems from the prestige of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its associated epistemic community, and from the cultural authority science exerts on government employees; these two factors bestow cultural authority onto the IS approach. The perceived scientific validity of the IS approach also leads government employees to consider its underlying economistic worldview as an unquestionable reality."/>

Understanding the factors that drive or inhibit this process, thus, becomes a priority. Yet, the increasingly prolific academic literature dealing with university-business cooperation (UBC) possesses a strong focus on barriers rather than drivers and only examines few of the cooperation activities that exist in practice. This article offers a comprehensive review and analysis of an extensive set of barriers and drivers across seven UBC activities with a large sample of European academics from 33 countries. Results highlight that while the identified drivers significantly affect the development of all cooperation activities, barriers have more diverse effects. While significantly limiting research and valorization activities, they barely impact cooperation in education. Additionally, results show that even if academics perceive no barriers they still may not cooperate with business if there are no drivers in place. This article concludes by discussing the relevant implications for research, management and policy development regarding UBC, leading to directions for future research."/>

Literature has ascribed Japan&apos;s weakness - or conversely, America&apos;s strength - to the specific institutional settings and competences of actors within the respective national innovation system. it has additionally been argued that unlike the American innovation system, with its proven ability to give birth to new industries, the inherent path dependency of the Japanese innovation system makes innovation and establishment of new industries quite difficult. However, there are two notable weaknesses underlying current propositions postulating that only certain innovation systems enable the creation of new industries: first, they mistakenly confound context specific with general empirical observations. And second, they grossly underestimate - or altogether fail to examine - the dynamics within innovation systems. This paper will show that it is precisely the dynamics within innovation systems - dynamics founded on the concept of path plasticity - which have enabled Japan to charge forward as a global leader in a highly innovative field: the game software sector.

We place the creation and subsequent evolution of ARD within its historical context and show how it was an innovation by Boston-area civic elites. Using new historical data, we examine the evolution of ARD&apos;s practices over time. We argue that ARD&apos;s funding model constrained its functioning as a venture capital firm and contributed to its demise. ARD was a pioneering organization whose business model ultimately failed as a newer organizational model, the limited partnership, was created and had a better fit with the business environment.

The utilization concept and the dual role of KIBS were verified. The results show that externally available information affects all innovation capabilities of the firm, while external expert organizations affect only the firm&apos;s R&amp;D and resources allocation capabilities.

The aim of this paper is therefore to fill this theoretical and empirical gap by explaining the firm-level factors relating to the market extension of KIBS within the framework of regional innovation systems.

Five variables were considered, that is, size, experience, service standardization, investments in network technologies and relational intensity.

The story of the development of VC is set in the technological trajectories where it has experienced its greatest success, the information, communications, and biomedical industries. The emergence of VC is intimately related to various government actions, and yet the paper does not attribute a deus ex machina role to government actors.

In contrast, the equipment and supplies sector seems to be largely ignored. This is surprising because this sector provides important input in terms of technology and material for the development of biotechnology in general. Our comparative analysis of the sector in eight countries indicates that there exists no specific science base for the sector and that it is largely neglected by public research funding. Commercial activities are concentrated in countries with a large general science base in biotechnology and strong multinational pharmaceutical or chemical companies. There is a rather broad diversity in the way the sector has developed in the eight countries. Our data support the notion that national peculiarities seem dominant for explaining this picture. We anticipate growing business opportunities for European firms to step into large markets of equipment and supplies for functional genomics and protein analyses where Europe maintains a strong science base.

Using patent citation data, this empirical study shows that Taiwan&apos;s Hsinchu Science Park is a healthy and knowledge-based cluster surrounded by the semiconductor sector, in which external knowledge is continuously playing an important role, while internalized capability is building up quickly; new and extended industrial clusters are being established by the growth of new ventures; and the linkages of capital, manpower, and technology flows are conducted respectively by the large business groups, the NTHU and NCTU, and the ITRI in the region. Subsequent sectors, repeating the successful model created by and catalyzed from the semiconductor sector are flourishing; the thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) and integrated circuit (IC) design sectors have been growing rapidly since the beginning of the 2000s, and the solar photovoltaic and LED (Light-Emitting Diode) sectors emerged quickly in mid-2005. The continuous evolving and growing industries along with the significant increase of value added in the Hsinchu Science Park have demonstrated it is acting as a healthy and vivid innovation region. The policy implications derived from this study can thus shed light, for the Southeast Asian, Latin American or other latecomers, on the strategies for formulating regional research and innovation policies in the process of developing a knowledge-based economy."/>

The importance of localised learning forms part of the claim for the existence of regional innovation systems or learning regions. This review identifi es how the importance of localised learning relies on assumptions about the forms of knowledge transmission, the relative importance of diff erent types of knowledge and the role of workers as knowledge bearers. It argues that theories of localised learning imply that knowledge is transferred independent of business transactions, that knowledge is a public good and that knowledge is most effectively transferred through face-to-face interaction. These assumptions contrast with changes that have occurred in the organisation of economic activity. Drawing on the concept of collective invention, it is suggested that localised learning may occur when there is a high level of technological uncertainty."/>

For this, research publications associated with UK SPs were identified from Scopus for the years 1975-2010 and analysed by region, infrastructure type and organisation type. There was apparently a systematic intensification of R&amp;D from the 90s as evidenced by the publications of on-park firms and research institutions. Science Parks and Research Parks were the most successful infrastructures in fostering cooperation and research production, in comparison to Science and Innovation centres, Technology parks, Incubators and other parks, and HEIs were the major off-park partners for the on-park businesses. The East of England, the South East, and Scotland concentrate the highest proportion of parks, each of these three major geographical agglomerations exhibit distinct areas of scientific specialisation. Parks seem to have a positive impact on the overall level of collaboration and production of science and technology, which are highly concentrated in competitive regions. Nevertheless, industry-academia collaborations show that on-park firms tend to collaborate with partners beyond their local region rather than the local HEI. Support infrastructures may therefore not help to reduce the uneven development and geographic distribution of research-intensive industries in the UK."/>

    <att name="AB" value="This article draws on the theory of conventions and the concept of worlds of production for an interpretation of the transformations of a regional production system over several decades. Wine production in the Spanish region of Castile and Leon has shifted from a world of local and interpersonal production (prevailing before 1960) to the current preferred orientation towards quality markets, having passed through an intermediate phase (1960-1980) of table and bulk wines industrial production. Recently, indications have appeared of a return to an interpersonal and neo-artisanal production on the part of prestigious winemakers who distribute their wines to selected international clients. This path is the result of a gradual modification of the dominant conventions of the business, which has experienced a spectacular development in Castile and Leon, whose wines are now appreciated in many foreign markets. This evolution of conventions may be interpreted as an innovative process maintained to challenge the trends and demands of the market. But this argument does not explain how conventions change and how these changes spread along the production chain. Therefore, this article discusses the contribution of three factors to this shift across different worlds of wine production: organization of the production chain: regulations regarding the protection of food differentiated according to its geographic origin: and the setting up of a regional innovation system which supports the wine sector.

This paper assesses the effectiveness of the South Korean technopark. Technoparks on average had a higher number of tenants, tenant employees, and tenant firm sales compared to those of the other business incubators in Korea. Although the survival rate was relatively high in technoparks compared to that of the other business incubators, some of the technoparks were not effective at encouraging tenants to graduate from the incubator in a timely manner. The support program provided by the technopark format enables firms to easily access innovation resources and to reduce the costs of doing business. The incubator reduces the operating costs of tenant firms by providing facilities and shared services at low cost as well as aiding in market expansion. Moreover, the incubator provides tenant firms with research and development support, which results in the enhancement of innovation capability. Nonetheless, the strategies of the technopark and local government have not been sufficiently thorough in encouraging the incubated firms to settle in the same jurisdiction, in order to promote regional economic growth and to stimulate a continuous regional innovation system. We explored the organizational performance of the technopark and ascertained the relationship between the organizational effectiveness and the performance outcome. Local government and the technopark should coown the objectives and connect their support systems, to lead the firms incubated in a technopark to settle and grow successfully in the local region. This examination of working technoparks in South Korea will contribute to the development of strategies for creating science parks in other developing countries."/>

It shows how many innovative firms operate within regional networks, cooperating and interacting not only with other firms such as suppliers, customers and competitors, but also with research and technology resource organizations, innovation support agencies, venture capital funds, and local and regional government bodies. The paper argues that within the region there is the presence of various renewable energy production platforms, usually based on core technologies (wind, solar, biomass, marine, etc.) at different levels of development. They involve a mix of established energy utilities and new sustainable energy businesses that are positioned at different levels within the renewable energy supply chain. The research shows that the regional government is playing an important role in supporting the renewable energy industry; nevertheless, more needs to be done to facilitate planning control, provide skills and create new demands for renewable energy that will further foster business growth and further strengthen the existing manufacturing base and innovation in Wales. The paper identifies some weaknesses in the Welsh energy innovation system, not least that energy is not a devolved responsibility and it argues that there is some scope for the Welsh Assembly Government to further investigate gaps within the green innovation supply chain and act on strengthening regional capabilities within the industry but also to support and investigate further opportunities for inward investment."/>

The paper highlights the business incubation system as an aspect of the triple helix model of innovation in which universities, industry, government and non-government organizations feature as principal actors in the national innovation system. The paper notes the need for both technology transfer and the development of the triple helix culture in developing countries. It also underlines the need for policy in developing countries to ensure that the former played only a residual role, while the latter took the lead in providing for the development of a culture of innovation. The culture of bureaucracy and institutional fragmentation has been a major factor militating against initiatives for technological capability development; and the conventional technology transfer practice has reinforced this culture.

It is important to stress that interpretation of innovation in business, industry as well as in public sectors is totally diverse. This complicates the possibility to understand the expression of innovation and more over to assess the level of their penetration. In order to facilitate the understanding of innovation expression in the state level the National Innovation System (NIS) is used as the fundamental instrument. This is a new standpoint highlighted in the article. It is stressed that effective NIS is mostly influenced by various public sectors, private business sectors as well as educational institutions. The business sector is responsible for the inspiration of innovation creation and implementation of appreciable innovative product or service. The public sector is responsible for policy formation and preparation for innovation expansion at the state level. In the expert works different innovation indexes are used in order to assess the value of innovation expression as well as the effectiveness of NIS functioning in the state level. The main peculiarities of these indexes are highlighted in the article. The article solves the scientific problem which is directly correlated with the situation that there is no unit classification of possible indexes (models) for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. According to all arguments mentioned, the authors of this article raise the aim to use analytical (theoretical) as well as empirical methods to systematize the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level as well as to present possible methods and areas of it&apos;s application (Lithuania&apos;s case). To achieve this aim free tasks were solved in the article: to highlight the main peculiarities of existing indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to systematize the groups of quantitative and qualitative criteria as well as to perform empirical research in order to present the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level; to provide the possible methods and areas of application of evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level. The essential result of the research was the classification of possible indexes for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level into two groups. Using the comparison method, all criteria were systematized into 14 quantitative and 11 qualitative criteria. As the consequence of selection of criteria the basic frequently recurrent groups where highlighted (human resource, innovators, economic effect, environment, investment for education, conditions for business provided by public institutions, general infrastructure, scientific output, knowledge creation, investor and creditor conditions, entrepreneurship). The empirical research enabled to specify and adapt for Lithuania the evolvent of criteria for the assessment of innovation expression in the state level.

    <att name="AB" value="It is widely acknowledged that the rate of innovations can be enhanced through interaction between new constellations of actors, crossing borderlines between different mindsets, knowledge and skill bases (e.g. Brown and Duguid, Org Sci 2(1):40-57, 1991; Cooke and Morgan, The associational economy: firms, regions, and innovation, 1998; Leonard-Barton, Wellsprings of knowledge: building and sustaining the sources of innovation, 1995, p. 64; Stamm, Managing innovation, design and creativity, 2008, p. 335). Studies of economic prosperity have also pointed to cooperation and competition between neighboring actors as a driver for competitiveness and innovativeness, be it for a company, a business area or a region (e.g. Piore and Sabel, The second industrial divide: possibilities for prosperity, 1984; Porter, The competitive advantage of nations, 1990). The hypothesis behind the geographical focus is that geographical proximity between actors promotes interaction and hence innovation. In EU, and also in Norway, this has been used actively as guidance in national and regional policy, where construction of innovation systems such as clusters and interorganizational networks are promoted and funded. To get organizations and institutions in a region to collaborate more is seen as the panacea for innovation, transformation and prosperity. However, companies often treat such constructed initiatives as an add-on to their ordinary, often long-lasting, business relationships between customers and suppliers (HAyenkansson et al., Business in networks, 2009, p. 13). This could imply that the necessary anchoring of such new innovation system initiatives with the companies&apos; own innovation processes is weak or missing. The terminology system points to the importance of the different elements (actors) in the system, their interrelatedness and their impact on each other (Meadows, Thinking in systems. A primer, 2009). An innovation system, like a network, cannot deliver innovation if the elements (i.e. the companies) of the systems don&apos;t respond with related actions to the common endeavor. However, the different actors&apos; intraorganizational innovation processes are hardly mentioned in the innovation systems theories, thus lacking the important system feedback link between the intraorganizational innovation processes within the single company and the interorganizational innovation processes which are taking place in the collaborative initiative. In this article it is argued, supported by a case story, that attention to both of these processes and the nexus between them is needed in order to construct sustainable interorganizational innovation system initiatives. A model for this is proposed, based on a dual organization development process, encouraging system feedback loops and thereby bridging the single participating organization and the interorganizational collaborative initiative."/>

According to the empirical findings of a European TSER project (SMEPOL) this was not fully confirmed: SMEs are less often engaged in innovation networks than larger firms and if they have innovation partnerships they are primarily concentrated on business partners.

Such products may be copies of current branded goods that are positioned as straightforward counterfeits, knock-offs, or Shanzhai. In this paper, we argue that this simplistic analysis is inadequate to describe novel approaches to the production of new goods and that a new system of innovation is emerging. This novel innovation system has a distinct set of context specific actors and intra- and inter-firm structures that have aided the technology innovations and the development of new business models. This paper employs a case study method and uses qualitative data to explore how innovations emerge in new mobile technologies and the innovation system that supports their emergence. It examines the Shanzhai mobile phone industry as a case and provides a first attempt to map the innovation system that has developed. The results suggest that the distinctive characteristics of the Chinese innovation system contribute to the innovations around the product and the production processes.

Building on the National Innovation System&apos;s approach, this study posits that a country can achieve high innovation performance via several combinations of causal conditions. These conditions are the five input enablers of GII: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. By defining two subsamples of countries (high-income and low-income), this study finds that several causal combinations of conditions lead to high innovation performance in both groups. In order to obtain better innovation performance, the low-income countries show more multifaceted solutions. These results indicate that none of the conditions is necessary for predicting high innovation performance in both samples. Additionally, in the low-income group, none of the conditions, individually, is sufficient to predict higher innovation performance, while in the high-income group the infrastructure and human capital and research conditions, on their own, are sufficient to obtain better innovation performance. These results indicate that the political decision making processes required for improving the level of innovation need to be different for each group of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prior research has shown that the propensity for discovering new products is greatest when firms cross a technological and/or organizational boundary in the search for new knowledge. In this paper, we add a new dimension to this literature: we examine whether, and to what extent, crossing a national boundary, as when firms use knowledge from network partners in foreign countries, influences the likelihood that firms will introduce new products into the market. Drawing on theorizing on institutional arbitrage in the literature on national innovation systems (NIS) and varieties of capitalism (VOC), we propose that companies that cross a national boundary in searching for innovation are significantly more likely to introduce new products. Detailed survey data on firms; data on their network partners, including their location; and regression analysis show that the use of knowledge from actors in foreign NIS has a positive influence on product innovation.

    <att name="AB" value="Background: Biotechnology complements technological developments in main sectors of economies, such as health, energy, and agriculture, and thus contributes to economic development. It provides solutions to the problems that are frequently faced in developing economies, such as resource constraints, lower productivity and environmental concerns. In order to benefit from biotechnology, its associated markets need to develop and function well to support the developments and transactions of intangible assets, such as technology transfers, license agreements and research and development joint ventures. Economic valuation of the intangible assets is necessary for the development and functioning of these markets. It provides better understanding of value creation at micro scales and its economic and financial dynamics. The literature lacks valuation studies in biotechnology sectors in developing economies. This study performs economic valuation analysis of a research and development project of a Turkish biotechnology company operating in health sector. Turkey, as a developing economy, has slow progress in biotechnology despite its wealth of biological resources and genetic variety. Thus, the study provides an excellent case to analyze valuation issues in developing economies. It uses data from in-depth interviews from the company and employs real options and discounted cash flow (DCF) methods. Results: Developing countries and biotechnology sector introduce additional risks that need to be accounted for in valuation. These risks reduce the value of the project under real options and discounted cash flow methods. Since real options method permits the valuation of options that might arise during the R&amp;D process and provides flexibility to managers to act, it results in higher values compared to discounted cash flow method. The grant from a public institution that partially financed the Project reduces the discount factor and thus increases the value of it. Conclusions: Economic values of biotechnology intangibles in developing countries are affected by country and sector risks and public financing. Thus, both microeconomic and macroeconomic policy interventions are important for the development of biotechnology in these economies. While public financing enables the risky R&amp;D projects to take place, it makes them more valuable than they would be under no intervention. Long run effects of these interventions require diligent analyses."/>

The overall target of the ERIS project is a quantitative and qualitative assessment of determinants crucial for the innovation potential of any region, i.e. innovative and non-innovative manufacturing firms, business services and research institutions, as well as the innovative linkages and networks between these actors. Empirical research is based upon almost 8600 questionnaires collected in II European regions. Results confirm some of the common hypotheses on the relationship between space and innovation networks but others are contrary to existing scientific knowledge. Obviously the impact of national innovation systems an the innovation activities of manufacturing firms in a given European region is-at least-as strong as the impact of the respective regional innovation system. The spatial range of innovative linkages significantly depends an the size, the type of the cooperation partner, the R&amp;D intensity and the industry of the analysed manufacturing firm. For example, the higher the technology intensity of the industry, the greater is the need of each firm to use intraregional knowledge via innovation linkages. It is therefore an important task in regional innovation Policy to promote network-building among firms and other actors of a regional innovation system and to interlink these intraregional networks with national and international knowledge sources."/>

RCC of Pharmacia&apos;s home region (Stockholm-Uppsala) is characterized by mapping all 75 new firms derived from Pharmacia onto the RCC space, revealing low RCC particularly for resources released from Pharmacia in highly decomposed form. Recombinations whereby managers from Pharmacia and other related incumbents become founders of new bio drug discovery firms (DDFs) come out as particularly scarce when benchmarked against the simultaneous emergence of a DDF sector in the otherwise comparable Copenhagen region. Venture capital is argued to be a key mechanism in RCC affecting high-tech entrepreneurship.

    <att name="AB" value="Several notions of a R&amp;D paradox can be found in the literature. In the Swedish Paradox version, the emphasis is normally on high and growing levels of business R&amp;D connected to comparatively low GDP growth rates. This paper examines whether this pattern is consistent over time and, more importantly, which sectors drive the aggregate patterns. Based on an investigation of the entire Swedish economy 1985-2001, there is clear evidence that the paradox occurs only in fast-growing manufacturing and service sectors. Fast-growing sectors show an increasing gap between R&amp;D and value-added growth, while the slow-growing sectors do not. This paradox is not interpreted as a sign of failure of the national innovation system, as the largest gap would then be for the slow-growing sectors, failing to transform R&amp;D to economic growth. The gap between R&amp;D and GDP is consistent with the idea of diminishing marginal returns to R&amp;D investment in high-investing sectors. The evidence does not rule out, however, that rendering the innovation system more effective could yield better outcomes. As the findings of a gap are quite consistent over time, it seems fair to conclude that businesses have good reasons for their high R&amp;D investments, despite not being on par with their production growth.

    <att name="AB" value="The aim of modern innovation policies is to enhance the innovation capability of regions, their organizations and people. Regional innovation system (RIS) theory has been one of the most popular frameworks for realizing innovation policies. Yet, adopting the perspective of sustainable innovation policy where innovation is also seen as a solution to various societal and environmental problems has been slow. Social enterprises (SEs) are discussed here as a means to address those problems, particularly through collaboration between sectors and focusing on social sustainability. The aim of this paper is to identify whether and in what way SEs are communicated as an innovative solution and as a source of innovations for economic and development activities through regional strategies. The data consist of regional innovation and business strategies from all Finnish regions, analysed using qualitative content analysis. We argue that there is a need to go deeper and include effective support mechanisms for SEs in these documents. Better inclusion of SEs as part of innovation systems and communicating this through regional strategies would help to develop SEs and to have them perceived as potential innovators and active entrepreneurial actors in innovation systems contributing to economically, environmentally and socially sustainable development."/>

We define COI as environments that favor the creation and development of high potential entrepreneurial ventures. COI are characterized by heightened mobility of resources (principally people, capital, and information-including intellectual property); increased velocity of business development; and a culture of mobility that leads to an affinity for collaboration, development of durable relationships, and the formation of Networks of Clusters of Innovation (NCOI). These networks are distinct sets of relationships. When the connections progress to the point of mutual dependence and business integration among participating enterprises, such covalent bonds form tightly interrelated business communities, or Super-Clusters of Innovation (Super-COI). In this article, we analyze the characteristics of COI and the nature of the relationships that arise between them to form NCOI and Super-COI. Further, we present an integrated model to better understand the global innovation system. (C) 2009 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. All rights reserved."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Internationalization in R&amp;D is further growing; it is changing its geographical balance, as it is shifting somewhat to the Far East, and its nature, increasing the global quest for talent and good research conditions as well as for low cost R&amp;D. This paper focuses on the European perspective, i.e. it discusses current challenges Europe faces vis-a-vis trends in industrial R&amp;D, but the findings and arguments are more general ones. It argues that our perspective on internationalization is still shaped too much by a zero sum-rationale, whereby one location wins R&amp;D capacity that another location loses. It develops a cost-benefit matrix in order to capture the overall costs and benefits of international R&amp;D activities more broadly. The paper argues that more creativity is needed, that our perspective needs to be broadened to tackle all variables conditioning international activities in R&amp;D ( including local conditions of demand and discourse) and to stress the importance of the absorption of global knowledge by as many actors within an innovation system as possible. On the basis of recent survey data the paper furthermore concludes that public research should be thought of as a trans-national transmission belt of knowledge and as the prime factor that shapes the attractiveness and effectiveness of a location for business R&amp;D. Finally, it is argued that policy schemes geared towards international R&amp;D need to accept and tackle the issue of co-ordination of governance and to take advantage of the flexible possibilities offered at the European level, beyond the logic of the European Framework Programme."/>

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show the relevance of territorial innovation systems approach for non-central regions&apos; development strategies. The research made allowed to identify actions of collective efficiency to strengthen endogenous capacity for regional innovation, and also to detect some institutional weaknesses that inhibit the innovation dynamics in a particular rural region (Tagus Valley). Design/methodology/approach - The research followed an interpretive case study, of explanatory type. Data collecting method comprised semi-structured face-to-face interviews with business agents and local government members, direct observation of innovation activities and documentary analysis. Statistical methods to analyse the firms&apos; innovation behaviour, as well as owners and managers&apos; perceptions, were also used in order to improve the trustworthiness of the research. Findings - The results show that innovation is positively associated to a diverse set of institutional factors that shape a territorially embedded innovation system, in which the firms&apos; innovation activity is chiefly based on localized learning processes. Moreover, a path of smart and creative diversification area is detected, but there are substantial differences between firms belonging to agro-food supply chain. While food industries and wineries show very interesting levels of investment in innovation activities and external knowledge synergies, farmers/producers depend greatly from producers&apos; organizations. Research limitations/implications - Given the absence of generalizability and some speculative argumentation, further research needs to be done, especially about the critical role of higher education institutions to promote innovation. Practical implications - The paper provides empirical insights about the role of actors belonging to the governance layer inherent to the territorial innovation system in discussion. Originality/value - The paper fulfils an identified need to systematize institutional factors able to affect non-central regions innovation."/>

I argue that Greater Boston&apos;s population of small- and medium-sized high-tech enterprises offers a systemic form of opportunity creation and enacting processes for industrial innovation. But they do not do so alone. The population of enterprises is embedded in a regional industrial ecosystem that facilitates ongoing reshuffling of the region&apos;s expertise, technology capabilities and financial resources for not only a single company but for a cluster of companies to grow fast. The concept of a regional industrial ecosystem suggests a locality analogous to Darwin&apos;s &apos;small area&apos; in which a &apos;manufactory of species&apos; is active but applied to the emergence, coadaptation, and growth of diverse sectors.

    <att name="AB" value="Globalisation and structural and demographic change are presenting Japan&apos;s economy and many regional economies with major challenges. In earlier decades, the international transfer of technology was an important factor in Japan&apos;s rise to become one of the leading industrialised nations. Today, however, the focus is on the interregional and intraregional transfer of technology between research institutions and private firms when addressing the issue of national and regional competitiveness. Regional innovation policies, in particular those under the responsibility of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and its regional bureaus, have for several years been making a great effort to promote the intraregional transfer of technology and business start-ups. This paper investigates the structure, the spatial reach and the innovation performance of R&amp;D networks that have built up as part of a regional development programme financed by METI. A social network analysis is carried out using a unique data set of joint research projects of public research institutions, private firms and government institutions. The results show that the spatial patterns of R&amp;D networks depend on the technical field of the research projects as well as on the role of the parties involved. Academia-academia cooperations have a much greater spatial reach than cooperations with private firms. The public sector plays an important role in local innovation processes."/>

Previous papers have shown that dense networks are closely related with innovation performance. Tight relationships in a close knit group foment trust among actors in the network and therefore promote collaborations, and diverse connections with the others can open an opportunity for breakthrough. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the network structure of an industrial cluster and compare its results with that of a field study, and found that firms in the cluster do not regard it as dense, which means that there are opportunities even in the densest network. This is because it is not so easy to look for business partners beyond a company&apos;s current partnerships while tight communication exists among firms having partnerships. Therefore, we propose a system of finding a plausible business partner to span the current boundary and to support the networking. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."/>

Whereas the development of new technologies was once dominated by large, vertically integrated firms, since the 1980s an increasingly networked innovation environment has emerged in which small firms play a central role. But why did this shift emerge? Extant research emphasizes changes in the decision-making calculus of large firms, the rise of private venture capital, legal changes and a variety of subnational development initiatives. In this paper, we demonstrate the critical importance of government innovation programs. We argue that a single small, relatively unknown programuthe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programuplayed a critical role in catalyzing this broader economic transformation. Drawing on programmatic data, employment trends and data on SBIRs intersection with venture capital and federal procurement, we show how SBIR catalyzed a series of cross-cutting institutional mechanisms that supported the growth of small, innovative technology firms. We propose the term social resonance to suggest how even small government programs can play an important role in altering large-scale institutional dynamics."/>

Rather than conform to conventional development aid projects of either a &quot;research&quot; or an &quot;interventionist&quot; nature, it combines both approaches in a research-action program, which has more in common with a business development approach than a formal social science One. An important conclusion is that the work (and apparent success) of the project is consistent with an understanding of development that emphasizes the importance of innovation systems. It is also an example of the importance of continuous learning and of institutional change. In contrast to much conventional development aid, it is an interesting example of how projects can actually lead to long-term sustainable changes that survive the withdrawal of the donor, having built capacity that truly means self-sufficiency. It is therefore an approach that deserves careful consideration on the part of all participants in international development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."/>

The research questions are: (a) are the investigated innovation initiatives context sensitive and customized to the prevailing innovation problems and, hence, to what extent do they focus on overcoming specific bottlenecks in the particular regional innovation system and address system failures hampering innovation; (b) have innovation policies aiming to support specific industries recognized the differences and, if yes, have they been customized accordingly? The paper discusses emerging forms of local/regional innovation policy using, as cases in point, Finland and especially two different industries (intelligent machinery and digital content services) in three different kinds of regional innovation system. The empirical research is based on data gathered (a) through 40 interviews with Finnish innovation policy makers and (b) through 91 structured interviews with firm representatives; (c) in addition, interview data from another study with 53 national-level innovation policy makers are exploited.

    <att name="AB" value="Norway has built up a remarkable solar photovoltaic (PV) industry over the last 15 years with central industrial players such as the Renewable Energy Corporation Group and Elkem. Norwegian companies are mainly active in manufacturing materials for solar cells, but also other elements of the value chain for solar PVs, such as manufacturing of solar cells, recycling of silicone and of solar cells have become a business target. Analyses of industry and innovation dynamics in renewable energy technology have been dominated by the technological innovation systems (TISs) approach. This paper seeks to complement existing TIS analyses by drawing explicitly on the regional innovation system approach to analyse the spatially differentiated development of solar PV industry in Norway. The historical account of the Norwegian PV industry and network analyses of its knowledge dynamics display a marked spatial pattern of both intra- and inter-regional industrial development. With its origin in Oslo-based Elkem, an industrial branching process took place which partly reinforced the Oslo region as a localized cluster for the PV industry and partly initiated the built-up of industrial activities in other regions. The latter process illustrates how PV industry emergence drew on knowledge spillovers from incumbent process industries through related variety. In contrast, the former drew to a great extent on urbanization advantages because of the regional knowledge infrastructure in and around Oslo. While this spatial unevenness perhaps has facilitated the built-up of industry, it also poses considerable limitations and challenges in the longer term."/>

In order to understand the factors that affect innovation and business performance, the Sectoral Innovation System (SIS) framework was used to analyse the linkages and interactions among the different actors in the Dutch vegetable breeding industry. Within SIS, five interacting domains are recognized and analysed: the business domain, the research &amp; education domain, the intermediate organizations, the market demand, and the infrastructure &amp; framework conditions, resulting in an integrated picture of the innovation system. It was found that the business domain, the research &amp; education domain and the intermediate organisations do not only show an outstanding individual performance, but more importantly, they closely collaborate via public-private partnerships (PPP), research consortia, etc. It is shown that especially the cluster characteristics of the Dutch vegetable breeding industry, i.e. the geographical proximity and the high level of intra- and interconnectivity within and between domains, induces an intensive knowledge flow, a key indicator for the innovation level of a sector.

However, according to another scale-independent indicator, namely the adjusted relative citation impact (ARCI), China ranks on the bottom of the list, but the growth rate of the ARCI is the highest among these countries (comparing the periods 1995-1999 and 2001-2005). To sum up, we interpret these findings to mean that the scientific outputs and impacts of China show a real tendency of catching up with its economic growth. It is expected that with an increase of its GDP and R&amp;D intensity China will show a sustained increase in indicators related to science and technology. Similarly, there are very strong &apos;Matthew effects&apos; between the outputs of technology (patents) and economic growth and research investment. This means that the outputs of technology are expected to increase considerably with an increase of GDP and R&amp;D expenditure. Furthermore, in the Chinese innovation system the government intramural expenditure on R&amp;D (GOVERD) has a stronger non-linear impact on patent productivity than business enterprise expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD). This shows that in China research institutions financed by the government play a more important role than enterprises. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."/>

    <att name="AB" value="The relationship between knowledge investments, innovation and competitiveness is an important topic in both academic research and economic policy and has been studied extensively over the past decades. Nowadays, investments in private and public R&amp;D are believed to make up the heart of a modem knowledge economy. The present paper adopts an evolutionary economics perspective and investigates whether, in addition to private R&amp;D activities, also institutional support systems and policy interventions play a role in inducing innovation initiatives and creating impacts on the performance and competitiveness of industries. We aim to find support for the hypothesis that the competitiveness of industries in the international arena is sustained by the dynamic interaction between national, regional and sectoral innovation systems. This may provide stakeholders with a better understanding of the context in which they operate. Since according to the evolutionary metaphor, the growth of an innovation system follows complex dynamics that cannot simply be analysed within a static quantitative equilibrium framework, we use here an alternative approach based on qualitative pattern recognition analysis originating from artificial intelligence analysis. Besides R&amp;D expenditures, human capital expenditures are regarded as the major input in the knowledge creation process in our analytical framework To this end, in our paper a qualitative causal model that maps out conditional relations between key factors in national innovation systems will be described. The focus of our investigation is on systematic patterns in the competitiveness of the EU Member States, using statistical information on innovation input and output data from the European Innovation Scoreboard. In our analysis we find support for the hypothesis that there are indeed significant interactions between distinct institutional levels, which may provide guidance to the strategic orientation of nations and the European Union in terms of the emphasis on competitiveness vis-A-vis cohesion.

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have long been the main carrier of technology innovation and technology transformation in China, and the main force of technological innovation. The &quot;Twelfth Five-Year&quot; plan puts forward the necessity of stimulating SMEs&apos; innovation vigor. Thus, whether from the subjective desire for upgrading the industry level, or from the objective needs of the market, technological innovation has become an important impetus for restructuring and upgrading many SMEs, and for enhancing their core competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to study technology innovation models from multiple perspectives such as growth stage of SMEs, the environmental features in the enterprises&apos; locations, competitive characteristics of the industries and the enterprises&apos; innovation ability. Design/methodology/approach - This research topic is designed to study the SMEs&apos; innovation ability and characteristics in the different stages of development and in different industrial and development environments. On this basis, this paper puts forwards a dynamic multi-dimensional technology innovation model, combines SMEs&apos; innovation practice to continuously improve their technology innovation model and establish the innovation system, thereby enhancing the innovative capability of SMEs and strengthening their core competitiveness. Findings - Through data analysis and research, the paper researches the SMEs&apos; technological innovation factors, and finds the development law of technological innovation; various different modes of SMEs&apos; technological innovation are analyzed from multiple perspectives to construct a multi-dimensional dynamic model of technological innovation. Originality/value - This is of great practical significance to China&apos;s economic construction and social harmonious development; the study of this topic will form the theory and methodology with regard to the SME&apos;s technology innovation model."/>
