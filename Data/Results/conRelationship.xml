    <att name="AB" value="Knowledge transfer offices (KTOs) are required to adopt a comprehensive approach to managing a broad set of channels of university-industry collaboration, including collaborative research, business services, exchange of human resources and informal relations within a regional innovation system. The perspectives of firms and academic researchers, the main stakeholders of KTOs, are useful complements to assess KTO activity. The goal of this article is to study the effectiveness that these stakeholders attribute to KTOs. Based on survey data collected in the Spanish region of Andalusia, the article explores stakeholders' perceptions and determinants. The results show that the level of engagement in a diversified range of activities and the importance attributed to knowledge transfer in the strategy of both research groups and firms are the best predictors of the perceived effectiveness of KTOs. The article also underlines specific differences between the two types of stakeholders." />

    <att name="AB" value="This paper describes how modularity is implemented in a roadmapping framework so that from a set of stand-alone roadmaps each could be used as an interconnected module, vertically and horizontally perfectly fitting together in an overall integrated roadmap describing a broad landscape of corresponding developments in technologies, products, applications, markets and society. The concept of modular roadmapping is illustrated by the example of a huge roadmapping project accompanying the innovation alliance &quot;Lithium-ion batteries LIB 2015&quot;, carried out by Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI, Karlsruhe, and funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany. The roadmapping framework addresses a broad technology landscape covering three focal domains: (i) Energy storage with lithium-ion battery technologies in general, addressing all kinds of corresponding battery applications, (ii) energy storage for electric mobility and (iii) stationary energy storage specifically. Each domain is represented and specified through a certain technology roadmap covering technological developments, a product roadmap assessing corresponding market trends and product requirements, and an integrated, unified roadmap linking technology push and market pull in a broader integrated view. In order to further specific insights for next generations of batteries in the above mentioned roadmapping project, modularity for integrated roadmapping helps to systematically link expertise on technologies, products, applications, markets and society in regards to overarching (inter-)national challenges (e.g. the German energy transition). Every roadmap forms an independent module for itself, showing different paths of future development and critical dependencies in each of the three highly dependent but also highly complex domains mentioned. Yet only through the integration of all perspectives in technologies, products, applications, markets and society, the aim of analyzing and documenting changes of innovation systems as a whole can be accomplished. From an academic perspective, a modular design approach in roadmapping contributes to more conceptual clarity, especially when providing roadmaps for a technology-driven innovation system with a core technology in the focus and multiple other competing or complementary technologies around. From a practitioner's point of view, guidance is provided on how to link developments and progression made in basic and applied science, industrial R&amp;D and socio-political trends, for current and emerging technologies and applications. The experience made and insights from various stakeholders involved in this roadmapping project are of interest and relevance for all actors, be they from science, industry or policy, as they may trigger the development of existing and emergence of new industries.

Our findings indicate important positive and negative impacts of the policy style on the TIS. For example, the muddling through character apparent in one of the policy processes negatively influenced entrepreneurial activities, knowledge development and finally technology diffusion, whereas the participatory nature of both processes had a positive impact both on TIS functioning and performance.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper presents an analysis of the knowledge retrieval networks behind the adoption of farm biogas in an area of Mediterranean Europe featuring arable farming systems. The overarching objective of the analysis is to help and understand the interplay between biogas adopters and the stakeholders of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovations System (AKIS). Specifically, the paper proposes an application of social network analysis that aims at bringing out the influence of knowledge exchanged within the system on adopters' business decisions, as well as adopters' contribution to knowledge upgrading. Social network analysis focuses on the estimation of three network attributes (cohesion, knowledge co-creation, and brokerage) using primary data, collected in 2015 via questionnaire to plant adopters. Self-education, upstream industry, agronomists, farmer/biogas unions, university, public-funded projects, and public research centers are AKIS' stakeholders, which adopters turn to when seeking for information and/or know-how. Upstream industry is the most influential node and the one that can help knowledge diffusion across adopters, regardless of their background. Self-accessible resources are major providers of information at the adoption-decision stage. The networks are centralized on self-education tools, while upstream industry and the Research Center on Animal Productions are the brokers. Policy intervention aimed at improving AKIS in the biogas sector should involve the upstream industry in decision-making, while considering the duality of self-accessible information vs. physical advisors. This paper shows evidence from a region where public incentives have allowed biogas diffusion, despite the region not being intrinsically suitable for it. Study findings may be useful for policy-makers and researchers who deal with the prevention, or mitigation, of the negative externalities of land use change via the promotion of informed technology diffusion.

With Taiwan as the research base, the key stakeholders in this study are university scientists, university technology transfer offices and entrepreneurs. The results indicate that the lack of mutual understanding regarding expectations and working practices is the most prominent barrier, while the rules and regulations imposed by universities or government funding agencies are the barriers with the highest influence on others. Furthermore, policy implications for Taiwan's university technology transfer are provided." />

The roles of ACE are discussed in the context of the university innovation ecosystem and through three cases of cleantech inventions. Surprisingly, we find that ACE does not include any ways to operationally integrate sustainability. The consideration of sustainability in commercialisation projects is case specific and fully dependent on other actors. As a result we propose people- and process-oriented alternatives of how sustainability could be integrated into university innovation support functions. We also propose that innovation ecosystems should be broadened to include public actors for the benefits of co-creating for sustainability." />

    <att name="AB" value="The process of innovation is crucial and essential part of economic growth. Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India, with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 2005-2010. This study examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs. Based on our results we also derive some policy and decision making implications for public research particularly in the context of transition economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To further explore the dynamic role of the universities interacting with the other actors in the innovation system, this paper examines the changing roles of the universities that have actively interacted with the biotechnology industry in Taiwan from 2000 to 2012. Combining social network analysis and interview data on a longitudinal dataset gathered from 125 IPO biotechnology firms, this paper aims to explore the R&amp;D collaboration networks between the universities and the other actors in the biotechnology sectoral innovation system to understand how universities make use of knowledge exchanged with other parties to shape society while developing emerging industries. The involvement rate of academia in the knowledge transfer networks appears to have increased since 2000 but more can be done to spur scalable action after 2008, and therefore association with other similar evolving areas. Moreover, the participation of foreign collaboration is one which needs some attention. The finding of this paper sheds light on the changing role of academia in developing emerging technologies in technology followers, while the innovation ecosystem is ready for academia-industry collaboration, universities not only take charge of disseminating knowledge but also serve as the major intermediaries in the process of commercialising science and technologies developed through the universities. Future policies may need to boost more partaking between the universities and industries by motivating the transmission of knowledge capital through encouraging technology commercialisation in academia.

    <att name="AB" value="The emergence and diffusion of green and sustainable technologies is full of obstacles and has therefore become an important area of research. We are interested in further understanding the dynamics between entrepreneurial experimentation, market formation, and institutional contexts, together playing a decisive role for successful diffusion of such technologies. Accordingly, we study these processes by adopting a technological innovation system perspective focusing on actors, networks, and institutions as well as the functions provided by them. Using a qualitative case study research design, we focus on the high-speed flywheel energy storage technology. As flywheels are based on a rotating mass allowing short-term storage of energy in kinetic form, they represent an environmentally-friendly alternative to electrochemical batteries and therefore can play an important role in sustainable energy transitions. Our contribution is threefold: First, regarding the flywheel energy storage technology, our findings reveal two subsystems and related markets in which development took different courses. In the automotive sector, flywheels are developing well as a braking energy recovery technology under the influence of two motors of innovation. In the electricity sector, they are stagnating at the stage of demonstration projects because of two important system weaknesses that counteract demand for storage. Second, we contribute to the theory of technological innovation systems by better understanding the internal dynamics between different functions of an innovation system as well as between the innovation system and its (external) contextual structures. Our third contribution is methodological. According to our best knowledge, we are the first to use system dynamics to (qualitatively) analyze and visualize dynamics between the diverse functions of innovation systems with the aim of enabling a better understanding of complex and iterative system processes. The paper also derives important implications for energy scholars, flywheel practitioners, and policymakers. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd." />

Yet many countries' NIPs have resulted in tremendous societal benefit through both planned and unplanned action not associated with these goals. Socially important technology product platforms often are developed at facilities that are part of National Innovation Systems. Yet the policies that govern Social Entrepreneurial Action (SEA) at these facilities are unclear. If there is not a place for SEA in these facilities for technology transfer practice then there is cause for concern. Here we add to the growing literature on SEA by utilizing the case study method to investigate how SEA has been utilized by the US National Innovation Systems (NIS) for the benefit of society. We do this by investigating two cases which emphasize internal (corporate) and external SEA in a research facility within the US NIS. We demonstrate how a US national laboratory's external engagement of SEA led to one of the most important innovations of the last half of the 20th century - the Laminar Flow Clean Room. We also show how internal SEA led to the emergence of the National Institute for Nanotechnology Engineering (NINE). The &quot;NINE program&quot; created a pathway enabling the emergence of nascent policy makers, technologists and entrepreneurial professionals. We then provide a model for SEA at US national laboratories through technology able social innovators and identify a new type of internal and external social entrepreneur - the Technologically Able Social Entrepreneur (TASE).

    <att name="AB" value="The building sector in Singapore consumes up to half of the nation's total energy. The government has therefore been urging the transformation of the industry by targeting 80% of all buildings to be green-certified by 2030. Thus far, Singapore has done relatively well, and is widely viewed as frontrunner in this respect. This paper addresses the question: what are the benefits and limitations of Singapore's sectoral innovation system in spurring an energy transition in the building sector, in particular by up-scaling the use of green building technology? The Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) theoretical framework was used to analyze the Singapore case. Four SIS components were assessed: technological regime, market demand, actor interactions and networks, and institutional framework. The benefits of Singapore's sectoral innovation system identified in the analysis basically concern aspects of all of the four elements of SIS. Particular success factors concerned the launching of an integrated strategy to support green building innovations (i.e., the Green Mark policy scheme), implementing support policies, and setting up test beds. Furthermore, a masterplan to engage and educate end-users was implemented, knowledge exchange platforms were set up, regulations on the use of efficient equipment in buildingswere issued, and standards and a certification system were adopted. The results also shed light on key barriers, namely, the reluctance of building users to change their habits, ineffective stakeholder collaboration, and green buildings innovation support coming from the government only. Measures in place have been moderately effective." />

Evolutionary economic geography has renewed interest in and sharpened the conceptual lens on firms, their organizational routines and knowledge bases as well as the long-term, self-sustaining development dynamics, which may arise from their co-location in regions. At the same, it has been pointed out that an overreliance on imported evolutionary frameworks (such as Nelson and Winter's theory of the firm and their lack of an explicit social ontology) may lead to a 'theoretical relegation' of institutions and agency. It seems also that the policy agenda of evolutionary economic geography has remained largely implicit. In comparison, regional innovation system has been developed in closer interaction with policy-makers and has been used widely as a framework for the design, implementation and evaluation of regional innovation policies in a variety of countries and regions. The purpose of this article is to critically investigate what evolutionary economic geography brings to the policy table, and how this potentially can advance a regional innovation systems approach. The article specially focuses on how this may improve the capacity of policies based on a regional innovation system framework to support new path development (i.e. path renewal and path creation) to secure regional resilience." />

This is arguably counter intuitive since the gains from doing the R&amp;D required for technological catch up are thought to be very high and Griffith et al. (2004) have documented that in the OECD returns increase dramatically with distance from the frontier. Exploiting recent advances in instrumental variables in a varying coefficient context we find that the rates of return follow an inverted U: they rise with distance to the frontier and then fall thereafter, potentially turning negative for the poorest countries. The findings provide a new mechanism underlying the twin income peaks - poor countries cannot exploit technological transfer for convergence while middle income countries can converge rapidly to the frontier. The low returns found for poor countries does not diminish the centrality of technological transfer for development, but rather suggests the importance of factors complementary to R&amp;D, such as education, the quality of scientific infrastructure, the overall functioning of the national innovation system, and the quality of the private sector, which become increasingly weak with distance from the frontier and offset the catch up effect, (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V." />

We found that platform providers are emerging as the center of the knowledge flow activity in the ecosystem. By introducing a new network index, the Network Concentration Index, which measures a firm's knowledge concentration ratio toward subsectors, we also found that each platform provider shows distinctive changing patterns in their technology knowledge network and that each is forming its own sub-network with increased influence on affiliated firms." />

After an initial period, in which only proprietary standards were available, two large users started to develop open standards together with alliance partners and standard development organizations. Consequently, sponsors of proprietary standards change their strategies, also toward open, alliance-based standards. A central condition for this shift in standardization was that the two users controlled large shares of the market. Our research points to the conditions for user involvement in standardization, thereby contrasting three different settings for standard development. We interpret the case as an example for the larger issue of institutional structures in technological innovation systems developing over time in a patchwork-like way, thereby shaping and changing the conditions for strategic action.

    <att name="AB" value="Technological innovation systems (TISs) have found favor for analyzing a technology's innovation dynamics, Complementary to TISs, the sectoral innovation systems approach focuses on sectoral peculiarities regarding innovation. This paper represents a first step towards integrating the sectoral dimension into TIS analysis. This seems particularly relevant for multi-component technologies, since their underlying innovation dynamics involve multiple sectors. We introduce the &quot;sectoral configuration&quot; of a TIS, which relates to the number and types of sectors linked via a TIS's value chain, and elaborate how the sectoral configuration plays out for a TIS's functional dynamics. We apply our theoretical framework to the knowledge development and diffusion function. Based on a quantitative analysis of patent data for lithium-ion batteries in Japan (1985-2005), we find that different sectors vary in importance for knowledge development and diffusion, especially with regard to the technology's evolution over time. Our findings suggest that the sectoral configuration deserves more attention in future TIS analyses. This would support a better understanding of functional mechanisms, and therefore offer the potential to derive enhanced TIS-based policy recommendations regarding the nature and balance between demand-pull, technology-push and interface improvement policies.

Drawing on the technological innovation system perspective complemented with insights from the management literature on the role of incumbents in technological change, four issues are empirically identified as important for improving resource mobilisation for biorefinery technologies: establishing loosely coupled divisions in pulp and paper firms; creating internal markets for new bioproducts aimed at further technological development; entering purchasing agreements with downstream actors; and investing in new managerial competencies." />

    <att name="AB" value="The development of knowledge-based business opportunities in many economic sectors worldwide is often conceived through a silo-mentality, whereby efforts are focused in either industry or government entities in isolation. Without a systemic or holistic understanding of connections between these, any present or future project evaluation becomes either input-or output-based instead of having a comprehensive understanding of its impact. In order to address such a challenge, this empirical study focuses on the Spanish hospitality sector, which currently thrives by continuously accessing external and internal sources of knowledge, thus offering opportunities to conceptualise it as a knowledge ecosystem. Lessons learned from the Spanish hospitality sector have the potential to inform the design of online government services as part of a knowledge ecosystem. This can, in turn, yield further opportunities for innovation in the hospitality sector. A structural equation model validated by factor analysis of 130 hotels is used to assess the extent to which hotels currently benefit from online government services. This study concludes that online government services can be better fostered by nurturing external communities while also setting up internal working communities and practices. The model and its implications can also inform initiatives which seek to pursue ecosystem-oriented research and practice, as well as future policy and technology transfer initiatives." />

The technological regime of sectors affects the chance for latecomers to catch up, but the final outcomes also depend on the actions of governments and firms. A successful catch-up requires the growth of indigenous firms rather than dependence on foreign direct investment. The government has an important role, but different forms of intervention across sectors must be identified. For firms, adopting a path-following strategy does not bring ultimate success, whereas leapfrogging is often required. Any uniqueness in the catch-up pattern of China can be attributed to its large size leading to bargaining power in technology transfer.

However, market diffusion and adoption in China is not ideal. This paper examines the blocking and inducement mechanisms of China's PV industry development from the perspective of technological innovation. By incorporating a Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach, the analysis performed here complements the previous literature, which has not grounded itself in a theoretical framework. In addition, to determine the current market dynamics, we closely examine market concentration trends as well as the vertical and horizontal integration of upstream and downstream actors (74.8% and 36.3%). The results of applying the TIS framework reveal that poor connectivity in networks, unaligned competitive entities and a lack of market supervision obstruct the development of China's PV industry. Therefore, we maintain that inducement mechanisms are required to instigate learning-by-doing capacities, which may help overcome blocking mechanisms and offset functional innovation deficiencies. In addition, policy implications are proposed for promoting the development of the PV industry in China." />

    <att name="AB" value="The research presented in this paper pursues two main goals. Empirically, it aims to explore sectoral futures at European level in a range of different sectors (automotive, construction, textile, RIBS, wholesale &amp; retail), to identify cross-cutting patterns of sectoral change, and to highlight implications that these may raise for European innovation policy. In order to do this in a systematic manner, it also has a conceptual and methodological ambition, namely to devise a sectoral innovation foresight methodology that builds explicitly on concepts derived from sectoral innovation systems approaches. This theory-led methodology allows exploring and interpreting future developments at sectoral level in a coherent and comparable manner. Technologies and knowledge, actors and organisations, user needs and demand, as well as institutional and policy frameworks are taken into account; elements that need to co-evolve for any innovation system scenario to unfold. This conceptual framework is translated into a sector innovation foresight methodology that was used to guide a multi-sector foresight initiative. Based on a meta-analysis of insights from five different sectors, cross-sectoral patterns of future change as well as cross-cutting policy issues are pointed out. Three areas of cross-cutting changes have been identified: a) the shift from products to systems and services, b) blurring boundaries between sectors, and c) sectoral and cross-sectoral integration of sustainability demands, and the governance of interactions between sectors. Foresight projects at sectoral level have been conducted rarely as compared to technology-centered or societal issue centered foresights or retrospective sectoral innovation system studies. By relying explicitly on a theoretical framework of sectoral innovation systems, this paper explores the potential of better linking innovation theory to policy- and strategy-oriented foresight.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper investigates opportunities to enhance Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA) of emerging technologies within innovation systems. We address key challenges faced by policymakers developing innovation strategies for emerging technologies. In particular, we explore ways that FM might be structured to investigate the complex innovation system journeys of novel technologies as they are developed, diffused, and deployed. In doing this, we draw on concepts from technology and operations management and related literatures to more carefully characterise the: (1) 'technical infrastrucutre' required to develop emerging technologies; (2) key technology transitions involved in diffusion; and (3) complex industrial value networks into which they may eventually get deployed. We investigate the extent to which these categories are already used within national technology foresight exercises. In particular, we review over 240 international FTA-related policy, strategy, and analysis documents for 'advanced materials'. We find that - although generally used inconsistently and unsystematically within FTA - these categories repeatedly emerge as important elements in many policies, strategies, and underpinning foresight exercises. We conclude by arguing that these categories should be carefully considered in initial FTA design. And that, by doing so, FTA exercises may better reveal potential 'innovation system failures' and help policymakers coordinate policy actions in response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

    <att name="AB" value="The concept of smart specialization has attracted great interest and has been adopted widely in European regional and innovation policy. Foresight is an important part of creating smart specialization strategies. However, both the smart specialization concept and foresight have been criticized for lacking an empirical and theoretical foundation that can help guide their application in practice. This paper contributes to the theoretical foundation of smart specialization and regional foresight by drawing on the field of economic geography and elaborating a typology for patterns of smart specialization. We highlight that there are different paths to reaching smart specialization within the same industrial domain. The empirical research focuses on the offshore wind service sector in four regions around the North Sea. The findings corroborate a typology that offers four distinct patterns diversification, transition, radical foundation, and modernization all of which can enable the creation of new industrial activities where regions enter an emerging industry based on fundamentally different starting points.

To contrast changes and developments in science and society, specifically the link between both is addressed in this article by comparing the content of news articles and scientific publications. Thus, the aim of this article is to first argue the benefit of integrating the media in the innovation system debate because of its recognized role in innovation diffusion and to develop a methodology to automatically compare scientific and media discourses.

    <att name="AB" value="Agricultural advisory services are meant to provide farmers with relevant knowledge and networks for innovation, as well as adjustments to policy and markets in agriculture. Despite substantial investment into these services, there has been little evaluation of their performance and impact, in particular at a system level. A system level analysis is especially challenging in countries with a diverse and fragmented advisory community such as the United Kingdom. This paper proposes criteria for assessing advisory services based on a conceptual framework for analysing characteristics of advisory services as a component of the wider Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS). Using the example of the UK, we investigated characteristics pertaining to governance structures, capacity, management and advisory methods. Data were collected in an online survey of 80 agricultural advisory organisations. Findings showed that most criteria for functional advisory services were met: agricultural advisory organisations utilised diverse knowledge sources and cooperated to fill knowledge gaps; there was a stable workforce of advisors who received regular training; advisory organisations were flexible and adaptive; and all relevant advisory topics were covered. However, a number of client groups were not targeted by advisory organisations and some organisations used only a narrow range of advisory methods. The proposed criteria reflect a balance between a thorough assessment of a country's advisory services and the typically limited time and budget available for regular evaluations. The criteria and associated proxy indicators should be fine-tuned to reflect the individual country's situation, and quantitative survey data complemented by qualitative data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="Stakeholder involvement in research processes is widely seen as essential to enhance the applicability of research. A common conclusion in the extensive body of literature on participatory and transdisciplinary research is the importance of the institutional context for understanding the dynamics and effectiveness of participatory projects. The role of institutional context has become increasingly important in view of large international research projects implementing shared participatory methodologies across countries (for example within Horizon 2020 and within CGIAR programmes), which each have different institutional contexts. Despite the generally accepted importance of the institutional context for understanding the unfolding of participatory and transdisciplinary research projects, surprisingly little research has actually looked into its role in greater detail. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by studying how a set of participatory principles and methods in a European project on integrated pest management (denoted as co-innovation in the project under study) was applied by researchers and advisers operating in a single international research project under the institutional conditions of four countries. The principal finding of this study is that, although constraints and enablers of participatory research at the personal level (e.g. researcher identity) were similar across the studied countries, research organisation- and community-based constraints and enablers differed, as well as those at the level of the overall innovation system. The institutions at different levels interact and create country-specific histories and path-dependencies, which lead to different degrees of propensity and preparedness, and hence different starting positions for participatory approaches. Consequently, when participatory research methods and approaches are applied in different contexts following a one-size-fits-all approach they may be less effective if not translated to institutional conditions at different levels. The study suggests that large international participatory research projects make provision in their design for careful selection of project team individuals, the composition of teams, and pay attention to the room for manoeuvre that the project, institute and national contexts provide for participatory research. To support the adjustment of participatory approaches to local institutional conditions, large international projects would benefit from fostering learning spaces that enable reflection on translation to local contexts and are capable of connecting to a wider network of decision makers and influencers that can facilitate institutional change in organisations and innovation systems.

Communities of Practice (CoPs) are well known as effective mechanism to foster knowledge sharing theoretically and practically. This paper aims to explore the journey of CoPs driven KMS from the lens of individuals, firms' business strategies to the perspectives of national interest. On individual level, knowledge nodes are explored in the context of knowledge flow, which often transcend organizational boundaries and are distinct and different than workflow models. Thus, a CoPs centered knowledge flow model in a multinational organization is developed, implemented, and analyzed. On firm level, this model is underpinned in a CoPs framework built around four expected firms' major business strategies including four dimensions and sixteen criteria as a comprehensive mechanism to intensify knowledge sharing effect.

Design/methodology/approach - In a mixed methods design, the research work combines qualitative assessments based on support mechanisms with quantitative analyses based on the outputs of papers and patents in a set of 25 main keywords and related patent codes. Findings - The SoIS for the four countries are defined based on 40 support mechanisms in the six main activities or functional dynamics of innovation systems. In an 11-year timeframe between 2003 and 2014, the output analyses consisted of 42,812 papers in the Scopus database and 3,483 patents in the World Intellectual Property Organization PatentScope database. Best practices were further identified and used to make a set of five key recommendations toward activating SoIS. Practical implications - The synergy of each functional dynamic is necessary to maximize the outputs of SoIS and transform knowledge into societal benefit for sustainable development. Best practises include dedicated research initiatives in sustainability priorities. Originality/value - The paper bridges a gap in developing and applying a method to identify, compare, and measure the performance of SoIS. The results are useful to activate SoIS to accelerate the pace of research, development and innovation for better managing environmental quality." />

Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this study is the unavailability of secondary data for a long period of time. Social implications - The main policy implication that can be derived from the findings of this paper is that entrepreneurship education and training alone cannot create a diversified and knowledge-based economy in a short period of time. In fact building a knowledge economy requires more than introduction of entrepreneurship education and training. In addition to entrepreneurship education it requires improvement in the national innovation system, large investment in information and communication technology and a good macroeconomic performance. Moreover, the success of entrepreneurship education and training in fulfilling its objective requires a comprehensive strategy to be implemented over a long period of time. Originality/value - The paper represents an original work that links entrepreneurship education and training with the knowledge economy.

Based on a case of Danish manufacturing SMEs that developed their local ecosystem in an innovative automation project, we find key drivers and challenges that these companies encountered while creating and capturing value both for them and the ecosystem at large. While the value creation process is enabled by common goals and financial support, companies need to balance their core activities with their commitment to the joint initiative. Moreover, ecosystem development is centrally dependent on the value-capture process, which also takes place at the inter-organisational level. Such open innovation process implies a purposive management of knowledge flows at the level of the innovation ecosystem that fits a multi-layered structure of the business model. Our findings also highlight the underlying connection between the business model and ecosystem concepts." />

Some of them, for example, focus on financing innovation, innovation and employment, innovation and trade, competition, or intellectual property; some adopt a managerial perspective, while others prefer an innovation system approach in a Schumpeterian tradition, etc. This introduction to the special issue of EINT surveys a collection of 12 papers on the CDM model by 25 authors from eight countries. The papers take stock of the evolution of research based on the original CDM model launched 20 years ago, linking it to the previous literature, and proposing developments and generalizations of it in various dimensions." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - This paper aims to discuss and present the regional- innovation cluster policy for R&amp;D efficiencyand the creative economy. In particular, the R&amp;D efficiency and creative economy of Daedeok Innopolis are discussed for the science and technology policy of the R&amp;D regional-innovation cluster. In this research, the region cluster policy change, the creative innovation system construction, the manpower system construction and the support unification for R&amp;D and commercialization are presented as policy proposals for R&amp;D efficiency and the creative economy. Design/methodology/approach - In this research, the universities, research institutes and enterprises of Daedeok Innopolis were studied. Thirty people from the universities in the area, 30 from the research institutes and 30 from the enterprises were surveyed through the quota sampling of the non-probability sampling method for this research. These survey respondents were science and technology policy specialists for the R&amp;D, industrialization and entrepreneurial activities of Daedeok Innopolis. The methodological material is a questionnaire. The study's investigation factors were the government's role, knowledge creation and the network. Also, F-test, ANOVA and chi-square independence test were utilized for the survey data analysis. Findings - Regional-innovation cluster construction is a representative method of realizing regional development and competition enhancement. This research was found through the analysis that the government policy is very useful for innovation ecosystem development. The knowledge capability has been enhanced in connection with knowledge creation. Also, the network has been vitalized. New-dimension industry-universityinstitute collaboration and a human resource management system are needed for R&amp;D efficiency and the creative economy. Daedeok Innopolis needs consistent support for industrialization and foundation. Social implications - Movement of and cooperation among humans, goods, knowledge, technologies, etc., occur in many areas (science, the economy, culture, arts, etc.) because of the compression of time and space through informatization and globalization. This has brought about changes in cross-border, regional and national relations and has stimulated competition in the aforementioned areas. To date, a state-dominated system has been operated to deal with these changes, but it has been shown to be inefficient because it cannot reflect the conditions in the region and does not allow quick reaction. The advantages of the region must be identified and utilized to boost the survival and development of the region. Regional-innovation cluster construction is a representative method of realizing regional development and competition enhancement. Originality/value - The innovative feature of the study is proposed the science and technology policy (the region cluster policy change, the creative innovation system construction, the manpower system construction and the support unification for R&amp;D and commercialization) for the R&amp;D regional-innovation cluster through the survey data analysis. In this paper, the R&amp;D efficiency and the creative economy of Daedeok Innopolis are discussed for the science and technology policy of the R&amp;D regional-innovation cluster. The science and technology policy for the R&amp;D regional-innovation cluster development is examined for the first time in this paper. This research is expected to make a significant contribution to the establishment of a development strategy for the regional-innovation cluster, and to the decision-making regarding the science and technology policy." />

Based on the theoretical perspective of innovation and complexity science, we summarized the elements of the IURCI as innovation capability, research and development (R&amp;D) configuration, and knowledge transfer and established a theoretical model to describe the evolution of the IURCI system. We used simulation technology to determine the interactions among variables and the evolution trend of the system. The results showed that the R&amp;D configuration can promote the evolution of innovation capability and knowledge transfer and that innovation capacity is the current dominant factor in the evolution of the Chinese IURCI system and is highly positively correlated with R&amp;Dconfiguration. Theevolutionary trend of knowledge transfer was gentler, and its contribution to the evolution of the Chinese IURCI system was less than that of R&amp;D configuration. When innovation, R&amp;D configuration, and knowledge transfer are relatively balanced, the collaborative innovation system can achieve high speed and stable evolution." />

    <att name="AB" value="The strategic goal of economic development is the growth of competitiveness of the country through the formation of innovative economy, the operation of which is largely determined by the qualitative characteristics of the innovation system and the strategy of building national innovative capacity. This study attempts to identify the strategy of innovative development of domestic enterprises of industrial sector of economy, including those depending on the technological level of the industry. The main hypothesis of this study is that the current model of economic development of Russia focused on the export of new technologies, which determines the predominance of the strategy of borrowing in the industrial sector at the medium-and low-technology levels. We assume that different sources of innovation financing differently affect the industry, in particular, public investment has greater influence on the industry of high-tech sector of the economy, and foreign investment -on the industries which use the strategy of new technologies borrowing. The study also tests the hypothesis that such factors as the cost of staff training have the greatest impact on economic activities dependent on the labor resources development. The research findings suggest the specifics of the model of economic development in Russia, and show orientation on international experience in the building of the innovative economy. We conclude that the main source of modernization of production and innovative development of industries is the import of new technologies, at the expense of own funds of enterprises. In this regard, the article proposes such a measure as the formation of consolidated groups of classification of fixed capital and the establishment of the regulatory service life of the equipment in branches and types of economic activities which are of the highest importance for the development of the national innovation system." />

    <att name="AB" value="This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new, green industries from emerging by studying the rise and fall of the Norwegian advanced biofuel sector. It investigates three competing explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to develop a vibrant industry within this field: (i) the petroleum industry acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies - Borregaard (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo (biodiesel) - and uses their success and eventual failure as a key indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation system within this field. The article finds that the advanced biofuel companies were hampered mostly by inconsistent and unpredictable government incentives, and concludes that the third explanation best accounts for Norway's limited success in advanced biofuels.

In order to enhance small and micro enterprises' technological innovation capability, enterprises should build a well technological innovation system, increase the technology innovation input and be active in technological innovation activities, and at the same time, it is essential for the government to play a role of leading, make effective policies and build good environment. Therefore, it is necessary to collect and study on small and micro enterprises' technological innovation capability related data, cases and policies in order to know the current situation and trend of small and micro enterprises' technological innovation capability. In order to make the above-mentioned work more convenient and more efficient, in this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making for evaluating the technological innovation capability of small and micro enterprises with hesitant fuzzy information. Motivated by the ideal of dependent aggregation, we develop the dependent hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric (DHFHWG) operator, in which the associated weights only depend on the aggregated hesitant fuzzy arguments and can relieve the influence of unfair hesitant fuzzy arguments on the aggregated results by assigning low weights to those &quot;false&quot; and &quot;biased&quot; ones and then apply them to develop an approach for multiple attribute decision making with hesitant fuzzy information. Finally, an illustrative example for evaluating the technological innovation capability of small and micro enterprises is given to verify the developed approach." />

    <att name="AB" value="Precision farming technologies represent an innovation challenge in terms of their diffusion into farming practice, and create a new dynamic for research and extension roles. The purpose of this paper is to examine the interaction and distribution of research and extension roles of public, private, and agricultural industry organizations in precision farming innovation systems. We connect findings to the broader debates on role divisions of public and private research and extension in innovation systems. Two case studies were examined: precision dairy farming in Australia, and the use of automatic milking systems in north-western Europe. A timeline analysis method, underpinned by a functions of innovation systems framework, was used to examine activities of actors and organizations in the case studies. Three main findings were: 1) Complex agricultural innovations require a collaborative approach for successful innovation and diffusion. The need for, and type of, collaboration differs across scales from farm-level (individual learning) to a national and global level with issues of skill training and service provider capability. Additionally, a threshold scale is required before the commercial sector can operate effectively. 2) The presence, and limitations, of private (commercial) interests and their position as a key knowledge base in precision farming heightens the need for public research and extension organizations to promote collaborative innovation programs with technology companies. There is a key public or industry good role in providing 'back-office' activities to support and complement private 'front office' activities. 3) Public and private research and extension organizations can work together, however there are areas where it makes more sense for one party or the other to lead. For precision farming systems, the roles for public organizations involve leadership on data integration (on-farm and off-farm), integration of technology (via standards), testing equipment performance, and development of training programs including support of initiatives such as farmer clubs. The principle theoretical implication is that public, private and industry roles in research and extension should not be viewed as dichotomcius (e.g. precompetitive/competitive), but as highly fluid in terms of the moments they are needed, and the scale at which they are needed, within the technological innovation system.

Nevertheless, as technology intensive imports are not associated with superior performance, we argue that importers from developing countries may use foreign technology inexpertly due to the lack of absorptive capacity and the emerging nature of their national innovation system." />

    <att name="AB" value="Literature on transboundary knowledge flows has primarily focused on foreign direct investment (FDI) spillover effects in emerging economies during the last decades. Little has been known, however, about whether or not and how foreign firms learn from local firms to enhance their innovation performance. The existing literature on clusters lays much emphasis on the variety of knowledge sources in the process of innovation, but it largely ignores the social and institutional barriers to transboundary knowledge flows. This article argues that for foreign firms operating in emerging economies, the issues about legitimacy and liability of foreignness might inhibit outsiders from effective knowledge sourcing; therefore, the social and institutional structure in a region plays a no less significant role than knowledge per se. Based on a large-scale firm-level database from China's information and communications technology (ICT) industry, this article reveals that local innovativeness of indigenous firms significantly stimulates and enhances innovation of foreign firms. It is interesting to find that whereas related variety of a region fails to exert positive influences, ownership diversity and a low extent of market concentration that reflect the openness of a local innovation system significantly affect innovation performance of foreign firms. It calls for more studies on local institutional and social construction of interfirm knowledge flows." />

    <att name="AB" value="Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology has become a crucial part of climate change mitigation strategies around the world; yet its progress has been slow. Some have criticised CCS as a distracting hype, even as mainstream support continues. This article adapts the literature on technological hypes to develop a framework suitable for technologies with limited media/public exposure, such as CCS. It provides a qualitative context and analyses seven quantitative indicators of hype that are largely internal to the CCS technology regime. Throughout, the article contrasts results for CCS with those of comparable technologies. The main findings, which support the view that CCS has been hyped, are as follows. &quot;Expectations&quot; mounted rapidly in the form of project announcements for electricity applications of CCS and deployment forecasts in influential reports. However, announcements soon plummeted. &quot;Commitments&quot; remained high, nonetheless, judging by allocations in public budgets and number of peer-reviewed publications. Meanwhile, &quot;outcomes&quot; in terms of patents, prototypes and estimated costs reveal few if any improvements for CCS. Considering these findings and the characteristics of CCS, its development is likely to be more difficult than initially expected. Accordingly, this article calls for decisively prioritising CCS for industrial and, potentially, bioenergy uses. Coal- and gas-fired power plants may be replaced by non-CCS technologies, so power CCS development is far less pressing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

Drawing on the experience of an applied research center in Italy, we explain why academics are in one of the best positions to orchestrate innovation ecosystems. Two main rationales support this key role. The first is associated with the fact that academics are in an independent position, which is neutral and represents a middle ground between the different organizations that share knowledge to ignite and sustain innovation at an ecosystem level. The second rationale is associated with the levels of compliance and complementarity that academics have with the main purposes for which knowledge within an innovation ecosystem is created and leveraged. Two design choices seem necessary to materialize the potential key orchestrator role of academics: (i) the extensive use of multiple approaches of collaborative research; (ii) the creation and maintenance of a knowledge platform allowing academics to progressively diffuse and leverage the ecosystem-based learning mechanisms underlying each innovation effort." />

This paper examines the associations between the intensity and performance of knowledge exchange activities undertaken in UK universities with non-academic actors. Drawing on data concerning the structural factors of interactions of universities in the UK with external partners, the paper sheds further light on the nature of these activities through a prism of competitive and uncompetitive regions in order to better understand how universities may be able to leverage both their knowledge and partnerships more effectively as competitive assets. On the one hand, it is found that academics in uncompetitive regions are more intensively engaged in entrepreneurial activities but generate less income from them than their counterparts in competitive regions, suggesting that there are differences in the income-generating capacity of academics across regions. On the other hand, academic knowledge is found to be more strongly bounded within a certain distance in uncompetitive regions whilst geographical distance seems less of a hindrance to academics in competitive regions." />

This paper applies the framework of the Technological Innovation System (TIS), and also takes the context into account, in terms of the Chinese national innovation system (NIS) and the global PV TIS. It concludes that the rise of the Chinese PV TIS can be explained by the interaction of three context factors (the change in Chinese institutions, technology transfer, and the large European market) and specific PV TIS dynamics. The study empirically shows the importance of extending the national TIS studies by including the influences of context factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

We show how the pharmaceutical firm Roche acted as a powerful institutional entrepreneur by influencing the health-care system in England to create a market for the personalized cancer drug Herceptin. We demonstrate that institutional change can be preceded by a range of innovation system-building activities that are not directly intended to bring about institutional change but are required in order for institutional change to take place.

This has delayed the transition to a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy. In this article, we adopt the technological innovation system (TIS) approach to analyze advanced biorefinery development in Sweden, a front-runner country in current development. The analysis highlights a number of system strengths (e.g., long-term research funding; significant research infrastructure; strong actor networks) that have contributed to developing the Swedish TIS, but also important system weaknesses (e.g., weak coordination among ministries; lack of industrial absorptive capacity; unclear roles) inhibiting it. The article highlights a combination of four policy measures that build on the system strengths to address the system weaknesses: (a) the implementation of a deployment policy for creating domestic niche markets; (b) improved policy timing and more structured coordination among different governmental agencies; (c) the provision of stronger incentives for mature industries to invest in R&amp;D and improve their absorptive capacity; and (d) improved organization and financing of existing research infrastructure. In addition to the empirical contribution, the article contributes with novel insights into the TIS framework by highlighting the dynamics between system strengths and weaknesses, and suggests that system strengths should be better emphasized in future TIS studies.

    <att name="AB" value="Use of fertilizers has enabled a massive increase in crop production yields. However, this has come with severe negative externalities (e.g., greenhouse gas emission; eutrophication of non-agricultural ecosystems). Eco-innovations are one option to reduce the environmental impact of fertilizers without compromising fertilizer productivity. Although numerous eco-innovations in the domain of fertilizers are available, they have not yet seen a sufficient adoption rate. In this paper we explore main drivers for adoption of eco-innovations in the German fertilizer supply chain based on empirical investigations at three levels of the fertilizer supply chain: producers, traders, and farmers. We strive to take a &quot;chain perspective&quot; on environmental concerns and knowledge of fertilizer specific eco-innovations. The study was carried out in two steps: initially we conducted exploratory expert interviews with eight actors of the fertilizer supply chain. The statements generated thereby fed into a questionnaire answered by 57 participants stemming from fertilizer production (n = 12), traders (n = 34) and farmers (n = 11) level. Findings suggest that drivers for eco-innovations are perceived differently by the various actors in the fertilizer supply chain. Overall knowledge on eco-innovations decreases downstream the chain. By taking a chain perspective on the adoption of eco-innovation, our paper contributes to the emerging body of literature on drivers for eco-innovation, and also maps out managerial implications of fostering the implementation of eco-innovations in the fertilizer supply chain." />

    <att name="AB" value="European financial crisis has raised questions about the sustainability and the contribution of innovation anchors especially in Southern European countries such as Greece. This paper utilizes the concept of regional innovation systems (RISs) and introduces a methodological approach that allows for evaluating an Science and Technology Park's (STP) contribution into the corresponding RIS performance, taking into consideration (1) the RIS idiosyncrasies, (2) the dominant role of government expenditures on R&amp;D and (3) the underlying complexity of knowledge production and management, under alternative sets of restrictions imposed by fiscal consolidation on the preferences of authorities which design and implement Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) policies. Our framework relies on the estimation of a multi-input-multi-output latent knowledge production function approach and the corresponding efficiency indices. Data requirements are sourced from the Regional Innovation Scoreboard, for the four Greek regions and from a small-scale case study, with respect to the examined regional STP covering the period from 2000 to 2012. The main empirical findings highlight that the contribution of the examined STP in the corresponding RIS performance diminishes alongside with the decrease in GERD investment levels, with respect to all the efficiency indices. These findings are attributed to the structural characteristics of both the RIS and the STP under investigation, and capture their dependence on managing public financial resources for STI activities." />

This paper explores how China inserted itself into global clean energy innovation systems by examining the case of the solar PV industry. The paper decomposes the global PV industrial value chain, and determines the main factors shaping PV technology transfer and diffusion. Chinese firms first entered PV module manufacturing through technology acquisition, and then gradually built their global competitiveness by utilizing a vertical integration strategy within segments of the industry as well as the broader PV value chain. The main drivers for PV technology transfer from the global innovation system to China are global market formation policy, international mobilization of talent, the flexibility of manufacturing in China, and belated policy incentives from China's government. The development trajectory of the PV industry in China indicates that innovation in cleaner energy technologies can occur through both global and national innovation processes, and knowledge exchange along the global PV value chain.

    <att name="AB" value="One key approach for studying emerging technologies in the field of sustainability transitions is that of technological innovation systems (TIS). While most TIS studies aim at deriving policy recommendations - typically by identifying system barriers - the actual role of these proposed policies in the TIS is rarely looked at. In addition, often single policy instruments instead of more encompassing policy mixes are considered. We address these shortcomings by applying a more comprehensive policy mix concept within the TIS approach. In doing so we analyze interdependencies between the policy mix and the TIS by shedding light on the role of the policy mix for TIS functioning and performance as well as how TIS developments influence the evolution of the policy mix. We explore these interdependencies for the case of offshore wind in Germany, using data from event history analysis and expert interviews. We find highly dynamic interdependencies with reoccurring patterns of systemic problems and adjustments of the policy mix, which are fuelled by high policy mix credibility and supportive actors. Our study constitutes a first step incorporating the policy mix concept into the TIS approach, thereby enabling a better understanding of real dynamics occurring in TIS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Decentralized renewable energy systems may face a range of technical, economic, institutional, socio-cultural and environmental barrier to their dissemination. In the paper, barriers impeding the dissemination of decentralized renewable energy systems have been identified and assessed. In addition, appropriate remedial measures and corresponding responsibility centers as reported in the literature have also been discussed. Inappropriateness of technology, unavailability of skilled manpower for maintenance, unavailability of spare parts, high cost, lack of access to credit, poor purchasing power and other spending priorities, unfair energy pricing, lack of information or awareness, and lack of adequate training on operation and maintenance of decentralized renewable energy systems are found to be the most critical barriers. Long-term conducive policies, appropriate regulatory framework, financial incentives (capital subsidies and soft loans) to users, technology and skill development, internalization of externalities in the cost of energy, withdrawal of subsidies presently being given to fossil fuels, development of specialized institutions, cooperation with international agencies, participation of local community and awareness generation have been recommended for increased dissemination of decentralized renewable energy systems.

University-industry joint research did not act as a conduit of university spillover, which suggests that informal channels, such as voluntary transfer of academic inventions in return to donation, worked in the pre-reform period. Intermediaries as a part of regional innovation policy, represented as local public technology centres, exerted a positive impact on industrial innovations in the region. Their immediate impacts suggest the contribution of technology diffusion, such as technical consultation, that help small local firms solve current problems while their far-reaching impacts suggest the importance of knowledge creation, such as own research." />

Cooke, M. Heidenreich &amp; H.-J. Braczyk (Eds) Regional Innovation Systems: The Role of Governances in a Globalized World, 2nd ed., pp. 1-18 (London: UCL Press)]. We thereby exemplarily show how the RIS literature and the literature on regional knowledge networks can benefit from considering insights of the respective other." />

    <att name="AB" value="University technology transfer has been receiving significant government funding since 2012. Results of this major investment are now expected by the Turkish government and society, not only in terms of better teaching and research performance, but also of new jobs, new products and services, enhanced regional development and contribution to economic growth. This article examines the technology transfer capacity of Turkish universities and provides several policy recommendations for further improvement. The analysis uses the dataset of a recent project funded by the European Patent Office and managed by Ege University Science and Technology Centre (EU.EBILTEM-TTO) and the Turkish Patent Institute. This was the first large-scale national assessment of IPR activities in Turkish universities. The findings reveal an early-stage university technology transfer capacity, facing many challenges caused by low technology- and market-oriented research capacity, institutional obstacles to patenting, licensing and spin-offs, low IPR awareness and spread of IPR policies, and the current IPR regime. University-industry cooperation activities, such as contract research, joint projects and publications, consultancy, etc. that have been present for three decades in Turkey continue to be the major paradigm and tend to be considered as a separate strand from technology transfer activities, such as patenting, licensing and spin-off formation that are less developed. Systemic policy intervention expanded to the broader national innovation ecosystem to improve technology absorption capacity and interest in technology-driven innovation, together with a combined top-down/bottom-up transformative action that can accelerate the change of deeply-rooted old perceptions and practice." />

    <att name="AB" value="Knowledge transfer between universities and organizations is essential, not only for the organizations involved but also for the broader innovation system. Understanding the factors that drive or inhibit this process, thus, becomes a priority. Yet, the increasingly prolific academic literature dealing with university-business cooperation (UBC) possesses a strong focus on barriers rather than drivers and only examines few of the cooperation activities that exist in practice. This article offers a comprehensive review and analysis of an extensive set of barriers and drivers across seven UBC activities with a large sample of European academics from 33 countries. Results highlight that while the identified drivers significantly affect the development of all cooperation activities, barriers have more diverse effects. While significantly limiting research and valorization activities, they barely impact cooperation in education. Additionally, results show that even if academics perceive no barriers they still may not cooperate with business if there are no drivers in place. This article concludes by discussing the relevant implications for research, management and policy development regarding UBC, leading to directions for future research." />

    <att name="AB" value="Increased understanding of knowledge transfer (KT) from universities to the wider regional knowledge ecosystem offers opportunities for increased regional innovation and commercialisation. The aim of this article is to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse quadruple helix stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional quadruple helix stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem." />

    <att name="Z9" value="6" />
    <att name="AB" value="Technological innovation that is incongruous with established social rules and practices is often confronted with strong skepticism and a lack of societal legitimacy. Yet, how the early actors in a new technological field create legitimacy for new products is not well researched. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an analytical framework for the early technology legitimation phase that combines recent insights from innovation studies and institutional sociology. Both literatures agree that technology legitimation depends on a complex alignment process in which the technology and its institutional context mutually shape each other. Innovation system studies recently proposed to explore these processes in more detail. So far, this literature has mainly treated legitimacy as an outcome of overall system maturation and has not ventured into assessing legitimation as an active process. The framework we put forward in this paper conceptualizes technology legitimation as being enacted by different actors in a technological innovation system through specific forms of institutional work. This framework is illustrated with a case study on potable water reuse, in this case the injection of treated wastewater into drinking water reservoirs - a technology most consumers confront with revulsion. California is among very few regions worldwide where this technology is becoming common practice. Interviews with 20 key stakeholders and content analysis of 124 newspaper articles reveal how technology proponents worked on legitimizing this controversial technology by engaging in system building and institutional work at various levels. We outline how the legitimation process interrelates with other core development processes of a technological innovation system and discuss how our framework informs recent work in innovation and transition studies.

    <att name="AB" value="Growth of novel small-scale technologies (micro- and nanotechnology) is expected to change the nature of work in the future. Currently, Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) research in small-scale technologies, especially nanotechnology, is in its infancy. Since small-scale technologies are expected to bring about radical changes, aligning HFE to these technologies allows for usable products from the inception, rather than an afterthought. This paper presents an ethnographic study conducted on lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology in the area of small-scale fluidics. LOC devices are small devices where laboratory processes are shrunk into miniature size, often no bigger than a credit card. LOC technology promises low-cost point-of-care devices in health care, as well as applications in other emerging sectors. In this study, the fabrication and testing of the LOC devices using soft lithography techniques were addressed in detail. Specifically, it is shown that device fabrication in the laboratory entails a considerable amount of skilled workmanship on part of the researcher. Further, this study was conducted at a research laboratory at the University of Waterloo. Addressing laboratory research as a domain of study is a novel venture for HFE. With the growth of universities as major players in the innovation system, the university research laboratory has emerged as an important aspect of the commercialization and technology transfer process. Thus, conducting research in university laboratories will, in the long run, allow HFE professionals to play a greater role in the innovation process linking the university, industry and society. Thus, emphasizing the principle: good economics requires good ergonomics." />

    <att name="Z9" value="21" />
    <att name="AB" value="Recently, there has been an increasing interest in policy mixes in innovation studies. While it has long been acknowledged that the stimulation of innovation and technological change involves different types of policy instruments, how such instruments form policy mixes has only recently become of interest. We argue that an area in which policy mixes are particularly important is the field of sustainability transitions. Transitions imply not only the development of disruptive innovations but also of policies aiming for wider change in socio-technical systems. We propose that ideally policy mixes for transitions include elements of 'creative destruction', involving both policies aiming for the 'creation' of new and for 'destabilising' the old. We develop a novel analytical framework including the two policy mix dimensions ('creation' and 'destruction') by broadening the technological innovation system functions approach, and specifically by expanding the concept of 'motors of innovation' to 'motors of creative destruction'. We test this framework by analysing 'low energy' policy mixes in Finland and the UK. We find that both countries have diverse policy mixes to support energy efficiency and reduce energy demand with instruments to cover all functions on the creation side. Despite the demonstrated need for such policies, unsurprisingly, destabilising functions are addressed by fewer policies, but there are empirical examples of such policies in both countries. The concept of 'motors of creative destruction' is introduced to expand innovation and technology policy debates to go beyond policy mixes consisting of technology push and demand pull instruments, and to consider a wider range of policy instruments combined in a suitable mix which may contribute to sustainability transitions.

A loss of legitimacy, in turn, can have detrimental effects for an industry. In this paper, we study the rise and fall of technology legitimacy of agricultural biogas in Germany over a period of more than 20 years (1990-2012). The field witnessed impressive growth and professionalization for many years and has become one of the key technologies in Germany's energy transition. In recent years, however, it has been confronted with major criticism, which finally resulted in a substantial cut-back of public and political support. The aim of our study is twofold. In empirical terms, we will explain the technology's loss of legitimacy despite its compliance with original policy objectives: growth and maturation. In theoretical terms, we work toward a more general framework to understand technology legitimacy and to explain the institutional dynamics of technological innovation systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    <att name="AB" value="'Emerging economies' like Korea in the 2000s face major challenges as they make a transition from (a) a phase of economic development characterised by 'catching up' with the global technological frontier, involving technological 'imitation', to (b) a phase of continuing development based on the development of new knowledge for globally leading (post catchup) product and process innovation. That transition is about accumulating new narrowly defined 'technological' components of innovation capability and changing the broad organisational and institutional context within which the technological (and economic) process of innovation takes place. During the catch-up phase of technological and economic development in successful emerging economies, that institutional dimension of the innovation system evolves particular characteristics that are well adapted to achieving effectiveness in the catch-up mode of innovation. This paper suggests that (1) these institutional characteristics may be less effective with respect to post catch-up innovation and (2) the institutional context adapted for catch-up innovation may not evolve adequately rapidly into the new forms required for effectiveness in post catch-up innovation. Consequently, these rigidities may become a source of lock-in - so contributing an institution-centred source of 'failure in system transition' in the innovation system." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - This paper aims to argue that innovation system foresight (ISF) can significantly contribute to the third mission of universities by creating an active dialogue between universities, industry and society. Design/methodology/approach - This paper's approach is conceptual. The authors analyse the third mission and relevant literature on innovation systems and foresight to explain how and why foresight contributes to the third mission. Findings - The authors propose that foresight contributes to the third mission of universities, particularly to the research and development and innovation dimensions through the development of joint understanding of the agendas and future needs of stakeholders. In addition, foresight enables education to be designed to address identified needs. Research limitations/implications - The findings are both conceptual and exploratory in nature. Thus, the argument needs further examination through a broader study on foresight in the university-industry context and/or longitudinal research on the outcomes and impact of foresight in this context. Practical implications - The findings highlight the importance of understanding the systemic nature of innovation and its role in economic development. Universities must understand their role within the larger innovation system to fulfil the potential of economic development and by extension, their third mission. Originality/value - The paper outlines a novel approach of using ISF to promote university-industry partnerships and the growth of innovation systems.

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - In the modern knowledge-intensive economy, a nation's competitiveness depends on the ability of its constituent firms to innovate. Extant research in national systems of innovation highlights institutions and public policies toward innovation as key determinants that affect firms' innovation activities. This paper aims to widen the investigation by arguing that co-inventor connectivity allows firms to access the most tacit knowledge within global innovation systems. Therefore, it is one of the key factors that underpin a nation's ability to develop and sustain its competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - Using a data set of 406,168 patents from US Patent and Trademark Office during the period of 1975-2004, this study analyzed the Japanese system of innovation through co-inventor networks. Findings - Surprisingly, the authors found that compared to other advanced countries such as Germany and Denmark, the Japanese innovation system is quite closed. Originality/value - The dimension of tacit knowledge is crucial in the current environment of rapid cycle time, short product lifespans and increasing emphasis on exploratory innovation. Hence the authors speculate that closedness to global innovation systems could be one of the reasons why many of Japan's traditionally powerful multinational enterprises exhibit weak performance in recent years." />

The aim of this paper is to propose appropriate indicators and methodology to empirically identify the knowledge base of a region. The second aim of this paper is to use this methodology for the identification of knowledge bases in the Czech regions. The methods used for the classification include the point method and cluster analysis. Based on the combination of these methods, the Czech regions are classified into four groups - those with a prevailing analytical, synthetic, analytical-synthetic, and synthetic-analytical knowledge base. The Capital City of Prague, the South Bohemian Region, and the South Moravian Region were among the ones with an analytical base. A synthetic knowledge base was identified in the Liberec Region, the Zlin Region, and the Vysocina Region. One of the two transitional types was found in the remaining regions. In real-life practice the findings can be applied, above all, to the implementation of regional innovation policies, which should always respect the characteristics of the given region." />

Drawing on data from a survey of more than 200 European institutions we find: (1) Country differences are related to differences in the institutional set-up of technology transfer and to the (regional) economic environment which suggests multi-level analyses to properly take these interactions into account. (2) Institutions in a country usually excel for one performance measure which we take as a supporting argument for the development of transfer strategies. (3) Having manufacturing companies and a large share of governmental R&amp;D expenditure in the region matter more than the technology intensity and R&amp;D intensity of the regional economy. The latter result is counterintuitive and indicates that further research is needed in order to understand better where the clients of university technologies actually come from." />

This illustrates how pockets of excellence within an unequal South African skills and innovation landscape were effectively connected in order to build a critical mass of skills and technologies that were highly competitive on the international stage. This shows how, in highly unequal developing countries, interactive capabilities form a lever for access to the global science and technology frontier." />

    <att name="AB" value="In an environment where competition is increasingly fierce, it is essential to create an innovation system, that ranges from basic research to the transfer of developments for the companies and the whole society. To verify this process, the most of the works are using the record number of patents as a proxy, given the difficulty of measuring new products, services and process for the market. Based in incubators of technology-based enterprises, in this article this problem was overcome, by measuring their products, services and processes. Thus, we developed this work with the main objective to assess whether there is interaction between the resident enterprises in technological incubator of Maringa, external companies and university. The methodology includes a literature review on the subject, the development of variables related to incubator's characteristics, the application of a questionnaire to the companies linked to Technological Incubator of Maringa, in order to verify the new products, services and process related to research that hit the market. The results point indicates the need for facilitating the process of innovation and interaction with university and industry by developed innovations." />

    <att name="AB" value="Where and how new industrial paths emerge are much debated questions in economic geography, especially in light of the recent evolutionary turn. This article contributes to the ongoing debate on path creation with a new analytical framework that specifies the formation of generic resources in embryonic industries. It suggests that path creation processes are not only conditioned by preexisting regional capabilities and technological relatedness but also by the way firm and nonfirm actors mobilize and anchor key resources for industry formation. Our framework elaborates on the early industry development phase, extending the focus on regional knowledge spillovers in evolutionary economic geography (EEG) literature with recent insights on industry formation dynamics from innovation studies. It understands early path creation as conditioned by four systemic resource formation processes-knowledge creation, investment mobilization, market formation, and technology legitimation- that can be mobilized both from inside or anchored from outside the region. The use and value of the analytical framework is illustrated by a case study on on-site water recycling technology (OST), based on interviews with 40 experts in three Chinese city regions. The findings suggest that, despite possessing the least favorable initial conditions, a sizable OST industry developed only in Beijing. This is explained based on the specific anchoring process of the four key resources in the early development stage of the industry. Our results imply that EEG would profit from incorporating a broader set of variables than knowledge-based relatedness in explanations of regional industrial path creation." />

    <att name="AB" value="Small-sized and medium-sized contractors are characterized by organizational structures that are highly focused on control. As a result, employees concentrate on day-to-day activities with little time or motivation to generate creative ideas. Generally, the technological improvements of these companies arise as a result of problem-solving at the construction site. Nevertheless, the actual status quo is changing. Some Spanish public agencies are already considering innovation as an added value in public procurement; thus, large contractors are starting to systemize their innovative efforts. This means that small-sized and medium-sized enterprises must modify their attitudes towards innovation in order to sustain their competitiveness. The implementation of a system that enhances innovation and acquisition of knowledge may be the solution to overcome this disadvantage. The implementation of an innovation management system was analyzed in a Spanish construction firm of medium size for 9 years. The system builds on a set of processes aimed to generate innovation projects that allow the contractor to document the innovation, not only for internal purposes related to knowledge management, but also for external ones associated with obtaining better results in public tenders. These processes are as follows: (1)technology watch, (2)creativity, (3)planning and executing innovation projects, (4)technology transfer, and (5)protection of results. The final step is the feedback of the entire process through the assessment of the final outcomes. The implementation of the innovation system is ensured within the organization, through training of personnel, participation of stakeholders, and encouragement of the innovation culture.

Their early licensing agreements may contribute to enhancing the licensor's productivity, the licensee's competency, and the efficiency of national innovation system. However, later licensing agreements enhance the licensor's bargaining power. Thus, the timing of licensing is not only a policy consideration at the national level but also a key strategic consideration at the R&amp;D entity level. We first theoretically claim that the ability to &quot;invent around&quot; determines the impact of uncertainty attenuation on the timing of licensing on the condition of market friction. Based on this claim, the paper argues that technology transfers from public research organizations differ from inter-firm licensing transactions in regard to their timing patterns. Using the data of commercialization activity through national R&amp;D programs in South Korea, we empirically find that resolving uncertainties rather delays the licensing time for technology transfers, as opposed to inter-firm transactions. In addition, our findings provide evidence of frictions related to search costs associated with the unique nature of R&amp;D processes in public research organizations." />

    <att name="Z9" value="1" />
    <att name="AB" value="Background: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as an emerging technology, have become increasingly important in the development of human therapeutic agents. How developing countries such as China could seize this emerging technological opportunity remains a poorly studied issue in prior literature. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the research and development of mAbs in China based on an innovation system functions approach and probes into the question of how China has been taking advantage of emerging technologies to overcome its challenges of building up a complete innovation system in developing mAbs. Methods: Mixed research methods were applied by combining archival data and field interviews. Archival data from the China Food and Drug Administration, Web of Science, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and the National Science and Technology Report Service were used to examine the status quo of the technology and research and development (R&amp;D) activities in China, while the opinions of researchers and managers in this field were synthesized from the interviews. Results: From the perspective of innovation system functions, technological development of mAb in China is being driven by incentives such as the subsidies from the State and corporate R&amp;D funding. Knowledge diffusion has been well served over the last 10 years through exchanging information on networks and technology transfer with developed countries. The State has provided clear guidance on search of emerging mAb technologies. Legitimacy of mAb in China has gained momentum owing to the implementation of government policies stipulated in the &quot;The Eleventh Five-year Plan&quot; in 2007, as well as national projects such as the &quot;973 Program&quot; and &quot;863 Program&quot;, among others. The potential of market formation stays high because of the rising local demand and government support. Entrepreneurial activities for mAb continue to prosper. In addition, the situation of resource supply has been improved with the support of the State. Conclusions: This study finds that a complete innovation system for mAb has begun to take shape in China. MAb innovators in China are capitalizing on this emerging technological opportunity to participate in the global drive of developing the value chain for the innovative drug. In the long run, the build-up of the research system for mAb in China could bring about more driving forces to the mAb innovation system." />

To that end, we identify distinct stages of technology diffusion in the two countries in the period 1986-2012, and analyze the interplay between public policies and the development of the technological innovation system across the different stages. We show that the two countries' distinct development strategies for wind energy - China developed wind energy largely through its state-owned enterprises, while India opened up wind energy investment to the private sector in the early 1990s - influenced system outcomes in terms of technology diffusion, domestic industry structure, competitiveness, and ownership. By unraveling the interplay between public policies, investment risks and returns, and actor characteristics, we explain the differences in system outcomes and identify important policy trade-offs between the two strategies. Our analysis provides novel insights about the process of financial resource mobilization in technological innovation systems, the dynamics of innovation-system growth, and the policy trade-offs that must be reconciled by countries that aim to promote the diffusion of a particular technology.

This framework highlights the main processes or functions that occur in the diffusion of a new technology. The evidence obtained demonstrates that the fulfillment of these functions, which were mostly studied in the context of pioneer countries, is still pertinent to explain the formation of a wind energy system in this follower country. Yet the type of resources and the nature of the activities needed to adopt the technology in the latter often differ. This case provides new insights into the importance of functions that enhance the follower's capacity to assimilate the new technology (e.g. local knowledge development, experimentation), thus creating the conditions for a fast move as soon as innovations become sufficiently mature in the core.

    <att name="AB" value="The need for domestic smallholder farming systems to better support food and nutrition security in the Caribbean is a pressing challenge. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) faces complex socio-ecological challenges related to historical legacies of plantation agriculture, small population sizes, geographic isolation, jurisdictional diversity, and proneness to natural disasters, all of which underscore the importance of fostering system-wide innovation potential. This paper explores the factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St. Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and food and nutrition security objectives." />

    <att name="AB" value="Developed over the past three decades, the national innovation system concept (NIS) has been widely used by both scholars and policy makers to explain how interactions between a set of distinct, nationally bounded institutions supports and facilitates technological change and the emergence and diffusion of new innovations. This concept provides a framework by which developing countries can adopt for purposes of catching up. Initially conceived on structures and interactions identified in economically advanced countries, the application of the NIS concept to developing countries has been gradual and has coincided - in the NIS literature - with a move away from overly macro-interpretations to an emphasis on micro-level interactions and processes, with much of this work questioning the nation state as the most appropriate level of analysis, as well as the emergence of certain intermediary actors thought to facilitate knowledge exchange between actors and institutions. This paper reviews the NIS literature chronologically, showing how this shift in emphasis has diminished somewhat the importance of both institutions, particularly governments, and the political processes of institutional capacity building. In doing so, the paper suggests that more recent literature on intermediaries such as industry associations may offer valuable insights to how institutional capacity building occurs and how it might be directed, particularly in the context of developing countries where governance capacities are often lacking, contributing to less effective innovation systems, stagnant economies, and unequal development.

    <att name="AB" value="Background: Despite considerable attention currently being given to facilitating the use of research results in public health practice, several concerns remain, resulting in the so-called know-do gap. This article aims to identify the key tensions causing the know-do gap from a broad perspective by using a systemic approach and considering the public health sector as an innovation system. Methods: An exploratory qualitative design including in-depth semi-structured interviews was used, with 33 interviewees from different actor categories in the Dutch public health innovation system. The analyses employed an innovation system matrix to highlight the principal tensions causing the know-do gap. Results: Seven key tensions were identified, including: research priorities determined by powerful players; no consensus about criteria for knowledge quality; different perceptions about the knowledge broker role; competition engendering fragmentation; thematic funding engendering fragmentation; predominance of passive knowledge sharing; and lack of capacity among users to use and influence research. Conclusions: The identified tensions indicate that bridging the know-do gap requires much more than linking research to practice or translating knowledge. An innovation system perspective is crucial in providing information on the total picture of knowledge exchange within the Dutch public health sector. Such a system includes broader stakeholder involvement as well as the creation of social, economic, and contextual conditions (achieving shared visions, building networks, institutional change, removing financial and infrastructural barriers), as these create conducive factors at several system levels and induce knowledge co-creation and innovation." />

Therefore, actors in an innovation system need to engage themselves in complex system building strategies in order to create a more favorable environment for their emerging technologies. The bodies of literature on system building and innovation ecosystems have little overlap so far. In this article, we show how system building in a technological innovation system depends on different framework conditions in creating a market for personalized cancer therapeutics and corresponding companion diagnostics in England such as technological complementarities, timing strategies and organizational complexity.

Furthermore, our paper uses network analysis based on patent data to identify the occurrence of technology convergence in terms of its technological domains. Our findings are as follows: (1) the diffusion of technology convergence has been ongoing since the early 2000s; (2) technology convergence is evolving into a more complex and heterogeneous form; (3) convergent technology has a wider scope but requires more effort to develop than does non-convergent technology; and (4) evidence for the strong consistency of converged domains over time exists.

This suggests that rising public investment in university research is paying off, and that university research is industry-relevant. The data also reveal some unexpected changes: patenting by conglomerates rapidly rose from 2001, peaking in 2005, and then fell. Patenting by individuals has continued to rise throughout the period being studied." />

The findings suggest that the strategic catch-up models of South Korea and Taiwan have resulted in a much longer pulse in the growth trajectories during the transition towards knowledge-based economy than countries that are dependent on FDI for learning and acquiring technology during the early catch-up period such as China and Malaysia, while the results are mixed for Singapore.

As the market for PV systems in Sweden has grown, an increasing number and variety of actors have become engaged in PV deployment, and networks have been formed. The PV market has been utterly dependent on a government investment subsidy scheme, which has, however, effectively set a cap on the size of the market, leading to fluctuations in demand and difficulties for PV installation firms.

The research draws on the empirical historical scaling dynamics to compare patterns of diffusion, and proposes an explanation for these patterns with the help of the technological innovation systems (TIS) theoretical framework. The analysis uncovered an acceleration of diffusion when the technology attained the new market. The mechanisms that allowed rapid adoption were found to be, among others, transnational linkages and an improved absorptive capacity. The latter benefited from past investments in knowledge development, imports of state-of-the-art technology and construction of a local industry assembling available competencies. Targeted policies (e.g. tender-based feed-in scheme) were effective to stimulate technology transfer and boost diffusion. The linkages with the global TIS and the concept of absorptive capacity improve the understanding of the processes involved in the formation of a TIS in receiving countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our central concern is to draw upon the learnings of an internet-based initiative in the United States called eXtension to show how 'traditional' D and E activities can be transformed. We argue that organisations and networks involved in such D and E activities need to perceive themselves as belonging to systems that are socio-technical in nature. That is, the development and deployment of cross-jurisdictional and cross-institutional innovations are shaped by both the social interactions between people and the systematic use of technology to support distributed learning. We explain how the elements of an integrated model to support public KM can be developed to create the conditions for enhanced innovation.

Based on a comprehensive panel dataset of Chinese universities in mainland China in 2009-2013, we find that collaboration breadth and collaboration depth have a linear and curvilinear effect on academic research performance, respectively.

    <att name="AB" value="In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on demand-driven innovation, using a generic national innovation ecosystem map as a unifying framework. We organize the literature review around four key innovation dimensions and seven related demand-driven processes. Our review reveals that business networking which accelerates access to new markets and technologies is vital for free markets. But classical competition alone cannot sustain the creation of new technologies or innovation paths. Rather, national policy is essential in creating lead markets. On the other hand the private sector has a crucial task in leading R&amp;D activity. We found that the relationship between R&amp;D stock and productivity is mostly positive. With regard to cluster strategies our literature review suggests that increased variety of innovative activities strengthens regional economic growth through &quot;spillover effects&quot; between products and industries. Based on the literature, we found that universities are evolving to play a major role in the research of innovation. The enormous innovative potential of universities therefore should be directed toward shaping more effective tools for public-private cooperation. But innovation, whether its origin is in academe or elsewhere, must follow a standardization process in order to converge into a well-defined technology. Our paper highlights a fundamental paradox underlying pro-innovation policies: while innovators often express the desire for a liberal, open and flexible market system with minimal bureaucracy and governmental interference, to allow market-driven innovation to flourish, they often benefit greatly from a variety of governmental interventions that include direct or indirect financial support (such as tax credits)." />

Because of this uncertainty, normative approaches to the development of low-carbon technological innovations will always contested. Q methodology, an established form of discourse analysis, was therefore undertaken in order to explore the competing visions and perspectives of experts working in the radical technological field of hydrogen production from waste. This is the first time that the perspectives of expert stakeholders involved in a technological innovation system (TIS) for hydrogen have been investigated using Q methodology. These contributors revealed limited awareness of each other. From this, we conclude that improvements need to be made to policies aimed at boosting the networks being used by the broad community of hydrogen-from-waste professionals.

The analysis shows that compared to the progress of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (HFCT) in leading countries, Iran is far behind the desired phase of development. This gap is partly explained due to the weak structure and functions of the HFCT system in Iran. Thus, the technology has remained in the demonstration phase for a long time. The analytical results show that the fulfillment of &quot;entrepreneurial activities&quot; is required for the transition of the technology to the pre-commercial phase. In turn, considerable financial resources are needed to accomplish &quot;entrepreneurial activity&quot;.

New knowledge and ideas, used by researchers themselves, in spite of its great value to education system i.e. remaining separated from innovation, do not give much to economic growth. Competitive research may result in scientific carrier and high worldwide reputation, but remaining with negligible relevance for the innovation system. For a stationary economy, where entrepreneurs are engaged in reproducing the given, this poses no difficulty. But as soon as development enters, and comparative advantages based on given products and technologies are eroded by newly industrializing economies, the situation transforms fundamentally. The production of new knowledge, to become an economic activity with high value added, has to become embedded into new combinations of resources. This requires a structural coupling of the science with economic development level of society. The traditional division of labour and functions between academic science and academic teaching, industry and society (applied research, development, innovation, societal benefits) becomes insufficient. Today university activities crosses traditional boundaries through linkages with the socially economic development level, it should develop new ways to interact between each other. The role of efficient technology transfer system, providing conducive to spillovers environment and society ready to promote technological adoption, implementation and application determines also new role for regional universities or research centres. Less developed countries have an advantage to adopt new knowledge created by technology leaders. The ability and capacity to absorb secondary or tacit knowledge may increase competitiveness on different levels. The aim of this paper is to systemize linkages of technology transfer process in less developed country into proper system model scheme as well as to stress problems of technology transfer enforcement.

For instance, biogas digester penetration in Rwanda accounts for just 1% of national potential as of 2012. This is in part due to the lack of innovation systems, which foster technology diffusion. This paper analyzes the development of a technological innovation system (TIS) for bio-digestion in Rwanda between 2000 and 2011.

    <att name="AB" value="Lack of access to modern energy services is a daunting development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. The promotion of renewable energy technologies (RETs) by development partners and government organizations is one way of meeting this challenge. Despite substantial investment of effort, the diffusion of RETs in Africa has been disappointing, leading to a search for more effective polities and approaches. In this paper, we discuss the role of technological innovation system (TIS) in fostering technology diffusion. We argue that the functional build up of TIS shapes technology diffusion levels in least-developed country settings. We report a comparative analysis of the biogas TIS in Kenya and Rwanda by applying the so-called the 'functions approach to innovation systems'. On this preliminary evidence, we argue that patterns of accumulation of TIS functions may determine rates of technology diffusion. We argue that to ensure accelerated diffusion of RETs, policy attention should be paid to improving the functional performance of TIS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="Z9" value="18" />
    <att name="AB" value="The 'Technological Innovation System' (TIS) framework and its system functions have become a popular analytical tool for the study of clean-tech innovation. There is increasing attention for the role of emerging economies in global clean-tech innovation, but the applicability of TIS to emerging economies cases is not entirely straightforward. A key issue is the limited geographical considerations, in particular transnational dimensions in TIS, whereas earlier perspectives on innovation in emerging economies have stressed the role of such transnational dimensions. This paper elaborates transnational TIS actor-networks and institutions, categorizes these in relation to TIS functions, and describes their potential to induce or block TIS development in emerging economies. We draw on insights from the perspectives of National Learning Systems, International Technology Transfer, and Global Production Networks for this purpose. We conclude that the potential effects of these transnational dimensions may be accurately grasped by the existing list of system functions, lending credence to its further application of the TIS framework on emerging economy case studies. Policy makers in emerging economies should recognize these transnational dimensions and seek to optimize their potential effect on domestic TIS development, taking in to consideration a realistic assessment of its role in the global TIS.

    <att name="AB" value="This study investigates whether scientific publications can give plausible suggestions about whether R&amp;D support infrastructures in the UK successfully foster scientific activity and cooperation. For this, research publications associated with UK SPs were identified from Scopus for the years 1975-2010 and analysed by region, infrastructure type and organisation type. There was apparently a systematic intensification of R&amp;D from the 90s as evidenced by the publications of on-park firms and research institutions. Science Parks and Research Parks were the most successful infrastructures in fostering cooperation and research production, in comparison to Science and Innovation centres, Technology parks, Incubators and other parks, and HEIs were the major off-park partners for the on-park businesses. The East of England, the South East, and Scotland concentrate the highest proportion of parks, each of these three major geographical agglomerations exhibit distinct areas of scientific specialisation. Parks seem to have a positive impact on the overall level of collaboration and production of science and technology, which are highly concentrated in competitive regions. Nevertheless, industry-academia collaborations show that on-park firms tend to collaborate with partners beyond their local region rather than the local HEI. Support infrastructures may therefore not help to reduce the uneven development and geographic distribution of research-intensive industries in the UK." />

Focus is also put on the role universities believe they should play in Open Innovation, as well as the changes that might have arisen as a consequence of universities' greater awareness of this concept. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is an exploratory study based on in-depth semi-structured interviews of Pro-Vice-Chancellors (or equivalent level) of a variety of British universities. The study was designed around five main research themes: discourse, change, strategy, management, Open Innovation success. Findings - In addition to the traditional teaching, research and knowledge transfer roles of university, this study has uncovered a new role of universities: trusted intermediary (or &quot;Open Innovation Hub&quot;). Another key finding of this study is that it highlights the diversity that prevails in the UK with regard to Open Innovation. Research limitations/implications - The number of the interviews conducted for this study is probably not large enough to allow a solid generalisation. Data saturation, however, was achieved in this study. The insight provided by this study is particularly significant as interviewees were amongst the highest-ranking executives in their respective universities. Hence the views reported in this study are what &quot;drives&quot; Open Innovation policies in the universities that participated in this study. Practical implications - This new role of a trusted intermediary played by universities is very likely to change the existing Open Innovation landscape and re-shape policies. Social implications - The changing role of universities within Open Innovation context may potentially change the respective role of other stakeholders in the Open Innovation ecosystem. Originality/value - This is the first study aimed at investigating how British universities understand Open Innovation and what opportunities and challenges they associate with this process." />

    <att name="Z9" value="1" />
    <att name="AB" value="Purpose: The aim of the paper is to analyse the use of Communities of Practice and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance knowledge sharing between researchers and advisors. The associated research question is to what extent ICT supported a virtual Community of Practice and has been effective in counteracting fragmentation between research and advisory systems in terms of knowledge sharing between these two pillars of the Italian Agricultural Knowledge System (AKS). Design/Methodology/approach: The paper uses a mixed methods approach: a questionnaire submitted to the Community of Practice participants on their experiences, observation of interaction between Community of Practice participants and data on the use of the ICT platform. Findings: The ICT supported Community of Practice approach appears to improve knowledge sharing between researchers and advisors, and also draws in other actors of the broader Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System in which the AKS is embedded. However, ICT based tools alone are not sufficient and need to be complemented with face-to-face (non-virtual) interactions. A clear theoretical implication of this study is that this is an iterative process in which virtual and non-virtual interaction mutually reinforce each other: ICT interaction spurs real life and face-to-face interaction, and ICT supports follow-up on real life face-to-face interaction. Practical Implications: Communities of Practice can be a useful tool for knowledge sharing between research and advisory systems, but should have a degree of flexibility in terms of the topics they address and should accommodate new members when appropriate. ICT is supportive, but should be complemented by real life meetings. Originality/Value: The paper connects recent frameworks of the use of Communities of Practice with literature on ICT in agriculture and adds insights on the contribution of combining virtual and non-virtual interaction in Communities of Practice aimed at knowledge sharing." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose: This paper reflects upon the practice of Argentine rural extensionists working in the extension public system through the process of identifying different rural extensionists' types of mindsets and comparing them with transfer of technology extension approach, dialogical processes of horizontal knowledge exchange, participatory perspectives and innovation system approach. Design/Methodology/approach: A quali-quantitative investigation was conducted. Surveys containing closed and open questions were sent via email to rural extensionists. This allowed the researcher to identify their beliefs about different issues connected to extension practice. The sample was incidental (n = 219; 143 men, 76 women). Qualitative data was categorized and quantified. Finally, a two-steps cluster analysis was implemented. Findings: Two types of rural extensionists' mindsets were identified, one of which relates to the transfer of technology approach and other to the dialogical/horizontal model, yet neither of them fitting the ideal of the most important extension institution of the country, which supports an innovation system approach. Practical implications: Extensionists' practices and institutional ideals do not coincide. Reflexive training processes are required to make beliefs about rural extension explicit in order to build a contextually suitable extension proposal. Originality/Value: Through a quali-quantitative approach to the issue of rural extensionists' mindsets, this paper contributes to a better understanding of Argentine rural extensionists' practices." />

Design/methodology/approach - This study is a descriptive research. The methodology used for this study is qualitative/quantitative secondary research. The method will be used for two main goals. First, we used the World Bank's Knowledge Assessment Methodology, and the data are mostly collected from secondary sources such as the World Bank's Development Indicators for Iran and Turkey. Second, desktop research will be used to summarize and synthesize available studies on the consideration of policy-making toward KBE, especially among developing economies. Findings - The paper provides policy considerations around four pillars: information and communications technology (ICT), innovation system, education and human resources development and economic incentives and institutional regime. It suggests that regarding ICT indicators, Iran has to join international programs to attract senior public authorities' involvement and accountability. Regarding its innovation system, lessons for policymakers are implementing development plans and coordinating science and technology policies in the country. Moreover, the quality of education, in-company training, post-secondary technical education and scientific and technological workforce need to be improved. Finally, considering the weak macroeconomic circumstances, legislative measures are needed in addition to, establishing a promotion agency for foreign direct investment to coordinate the inflow and to grant incentives for attracting more investment. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results have not been confirmed by an experts group. Therefore, using some group decision-making methods, such as panel of experts, could be proposed to further test the findings. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for public policymakers, especially in developing countries, and for moving toward a KBE. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to learn from similar countries experiences in policymaking about the same problem." />

    <att name="AB" value="This paper describes innovation activities in the marine energy sector across ten European countries in 2011. Intense knowledge creation occurred in the UK and northern European countries, while European research networks encouraged public-private partnerships facilitating knowledge diffusion. An analysis based on a technological innovation system (TIS) has identified challenges for the system to evolve from one phase of development to another, i.e. from pre-development to take-off phase. In order for marine energy to pass successfully through the commercialisation 'valley of death', entrepreneurial experimentation and production is crucial. Entrepreneurial initiatives were developed mainly in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Ireland, whereas France, Germany and Sweden were active through venture capital initiatives. Additional system-builders, such as the authorities in charge of energy policies, could offer guidance for research, ensure legitimacy and effectively mobilise resources for system development. Although public support was efficient in stimulating private investment, national targets seemed less efficient in creating a long time horizon for private investors, due to consecutive, unexpected changes. In contrast, positive interactions between technology developers and policy-makers could empower market formation. Ultimately, the creation of a policy community, also involving local communities, could foster a positive environment for the development of innovation activities. (C) 2014 The Author.

The causal relationships between the systematic problems were identified by the survey and grouped into 6 components by Exploratory Factor Analysis: weakness in technology diffusion mechanisms, the lack of centralized governance on science and technology policy, the government's pivotal role as an executor in education and research, weak laws and regulations in the field of research and technology, the lack of adequate financial resources in R&amp;D and the lack of any perspective on the creation of wealth and entrepreneurship among the actors of research and technology. Finally the bottleneck of Iran's NIS was recognized by Thinking Process tools: the small participation of private sector in research and education system as the result of government's pivotal role as an executor of Iran's national innovation system.

In particular, we compared patenting and publication activities in Taiwan versus those of India. The results of our study demonstrate that the intellectual property regime (i.e., patents and publications) is playing a critical role in linking actors and institutions and is highly associated with the effectiveness of the innovation system in the pharmaceutical sector.

This research operationalizes previous work on the main drivers of the establishment of Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs), with the aim of presenting an overview of the typical systemic drivers within a technological innovation system (TIS) framework. This leads to the proposal of a comprehensive typology and categorization of drivers of RETs. The typology is validated empirically by analyzing data on the development of four types of RETs (wind, solar, biomass and wave energy) in eight European countries (EU-7 and Ireland). The study's results shed light on the multilateral drivers behind the development of RETs. Furthermore, a cross-case comparative study reveals the differences between drivers of RETs and the patterns of these drivers in different countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

This paper explores how technological, social, political, and economic factors interact and shape the evolution of the energy efficiency in building codes. Existing approaches to the evolution of standards focus primarily on adopting individual or multiple technologies or products, but only peripherally explore the feedback dynamics between innovation, diffusion, and standardization (IDS.)(2) To fill this void, I draw on the revelatory case of Switzerland, because the Swiss standards have continuously improved since 1970, whereas in many other countries improvements have stagnated after the recovery from peaks in energy prices. The paper's contribution is, first, a qualitative, structural model which endogenously formalizes the IDS-dynamics of standard improvement. I find that the co-evolution of voluntary and legal building codes have enabled a continuous improvement of the standards even in the absence of economic pressures. And second, I use the model for policy analysis, which indicates that several obvious policies might cause policy resistance and could result in uneconomical, counter-intuitive outcomes. Policy interventions have to dynamically balance the speed of innovation and the ability of system agents to change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." />

The goal of the foresight project was to identify the possible futures of the facilities management sector in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and, based on the findings, to establish a proposal for a common Nordic facilities management research agenda. The paper finds that three elements of the innovation system literature are of particular interest for the practice of foresight: innovation systems and context dependency, learning and user-producer interactions, and the role of knowledge and knowledge production.

    <att name="AB" value="Tourism destinations in peripheral areas are often large regions established by centralised government agencies to encourage collaboration between dispersed communities and foster innovation. Relatively little research attention has been paid to the impact that centrally defined destination boundaries have on whether and how small communities contribute to innovation at a regional level. This paper examines the case of Burra, a small town in rural South Australia. It analyses the networking, collaboration and knowledge exchange behaviour of tourism stakeholders in the context of the state-government-defined 'Clare Valley' tourism region. Data were drawn from a web-based social network analysis, in-depth interviews, historic document analysis and field observations. The study found that the local tourism system had limited aspirations and capabilities to collaborate with other towns in the region. Lack of regional engagement was only partially due to intra-regional competition and resistance to regional boundaries. More significant barriers included a local culture of operating in isolation, an embedded reliance on public sector leadership to manage systemic interactions, an aging system with limited ambition to change and an inability to harness in-migrants and externally based stakeholders to stimulate knowledge transfer. Changing the imposed destination boundaries would have limited impact on the operation of the local system. The paper concludes that effective regional destination development in peripheral areas needs to be better informed by more detailed understandings of local tourism systems and their capacities to engage." />

Yet drip irrigation's uptake is patchy, with conspicuous successes in some locations and failures in others. In this paper we compare the history and circumstances of the mostly failed uptake of drip technology in sub-Saharan Africa with those of its deep and robust uptake in the Israeli context in which many of the failed African systems originated. We do this not only to throw light on the contextual dependence of this particular technology, and highlight strategies that have been attempted to protect it from this dependence, but also, more broadly, to use the notion of &quot;technology translation&quot; to consolidate several streams of socio-analytic thinking that offer improved understandings of how technologies evolve and travel. Israel has long been a major player in the development and distribution of drip irrigation, with exceptionally extensive national level uptake. We suggest that this emerged from an integrated technology innovation system with a capacity for ongoing multi-leveled learning and dynamic evolution of the technology in light of context-specific potential and problems. Conversely, the failed uptake of drip irrigation in many sub-Saharan African countries can be viewed as a consequence of the transfer of static physical artifacts into new contexts lacking similar local systems into which these could be absorbed and evolve (re-innovated). We interpret two contrasting attempts to boost drip irrigation adoption as efforts to overcome this dependence: simplifying the hardware to become system-free, or creating a kind of remotely operated autonomous small-scale innovation system in which self-contained installations are bundled with resources and linkages to a directing hub. Drawing on several vibrant streams of literature in the sociology of technology and technical innovation, we suggest that the emerging metaphor of &quot;technology translation&quot; provides a better way of thinking about and improving what happens when technologies such as drip irrigation travel to new settings. Technology translation, rather than transfer, suggests a more dialogical approach emphasizing learning and using the local &quot;languages&quot; of the contexts into which artifacts will be translated, making artifacts supple enough to be readily modifiable within these, and finding ways to bolster the local innovation systems that will re-invent and re-link them into new relationships.

    <att name="AB" value="Regional innovation systems (RISs) literature has emphasized the critical role of interactive learning and knowledge exchange amongst firms and a variety of spatially connected innovation institutions as the foundation of regional innovation. Knowledge intermediaries have been analysed in terms of the technology-transaction services they provide firms and/or knowledge producers such as universities and therefore the role they play in facilitating interaction within the RIS. However, innovation also depends on the capability of the firm to learn. Some studies have suggested that intermediaries also play a role in that regard as participation in intermediary knowledge transfer programmes can contribute to the development of firm capabilities for problem-solving and learning. Our research is based on two case study intermediary programmes involving interviews with facilitators and participants. Our data show that knowledge intermediaries affect organizational learning capabilities by impacting on firms' network relationships, internal and external communication channels and internal learning processes which in turn affect the ability to interpret and use knowledge within the firm. This suggests that the role of knowledge intermediaries might be greater than facilitating interactions in the innovation system, as knowledge intermediation may affect the ability of firms to learn and absorb knowledge from their environment." />

The effectiveness of this strategy has been called into question. Empirical studies suggest that the benefits of SPs for high-tech firms are limited. While this debate is mainly concentrated in the US and Europe, this paper sheds light on the role of SPs in China. It is found that, despite the presence of alternatives, the locations of high-tech SMEs in the region of Shenzhen are determined by hierarchically structured and governed SPs. This finding supports the notion that SPs can play a positive role in attracting high-tech SMEs. Moreover, these effects occur in the relatively unexplored Chinese context of increasingly liberalised but governed market circumstances, where a mature innovation system is still lacking." />

    <att name="AB" value="Emerging economies are increasingly contributing to global innovation, including clean-tech innovation. The development of China's wind power sector has often been used to illustrate this point. China's domestic wind power market is the largest in the world and is largely supplied by domestic manufacturers. Competition for market share in the domestic market may pressure firms to innovate, which consecutively improves prospects for global expansion. This paper reviews developments in China's domestic wind turbine market using the Technological Innovation System framework. We analyze the pressure to innovate arising from market competition and assess the prospects for global expansion of Chinese wind turbine manufacturers. We conclude that domestic customers are not pressured or incentivized to perform with respect to power output, such that turbine manufacturers are not pressured to perform with respect to turbine efficiency or maintenance needs. Pressure to innovate is further reduced by formalizing connections between wind farm developers and turbine manufacturers. Chinese turbine manufacturers cannot yet compete with leading global brands in technological leadership. The prospects for exports are improved, however, by the preferential supply of project financing from institutional investors, such as the China Development Bank, from Chinese utilities that seek global expansion and from the manufacturers themselves.

In particular, we will discuss the new analytic frameworks that may open as a result of the incorporation of epigenetics in evolutionary economic thinking. This new approach is illustrated by studying the evolution of big Internet industry groups such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and Samsung. With it we shed light on the dynamics of business groups, which we approach as 'business ecosystems'. We introduce the concept of Epigenetic Economic Dynamics, which is defined as the study of the epigenetic dynamics generated as a result of the adaptation of organisations to major changes in their respective environments. First of all, this concept enables us to understand how the dynamics of the business groups mentioned address changes in their environments. Secondly, it is also useful when analysing the results of these dynamics. Abnormalities, malfunctions or obstacles to innovation, and/or blockage to developing competition at certain levels (i.e. intellectual property rights, abuse of monopoly power, etc.) may arise as a result of the influence of epigenetic dynamics. Acquisition of patent portfolios and patent lawsuits for infringements and violations are quite common, for example in the field of mobile telephony, which clearly shows the fierce competition between business groups. Essential patents licensing is particularly at the core of legal disputes between the business groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

It develops an analytical framework which allows investigating innovation processes (or 'functions') of a TIS at and across different spatial scales. Based on social network analysis of a co-publication dataset from membrane bioreactor technology, we illustrate how the spatial characteristics of collaborations in knowledge creation vary greatly over relatively short periods of time.

The key causes of the low level of the economy competitiveness are related to the decoupling between science and production, insufficient financing of innovation projects, absence of the efficient mechanisms of bringing scientific-technical production to the level of goods, high capital consumption. Renunciation of the raw materials model requires modernization and simultaneous transition to the innovation economy, as Kazakhstan relates its constant stable growth, first of all, to the transition to the innovation way of development. Today Kazakhstan is actively forming a new economy which is being built on the present day knowledge and competitive innovations. Besides, the purpose of institutional transformations is the establishing of the market innovative-active subjects. However, till nowadays the program of reduction of home economy dependence of on raw materials does not give the expected results and until this key problem is left unsolved, it will effect negatively economy's development, especially in case of the sharp worsening of the environment Unconditionally, there are other domestic problems that will prevent from supporting a stable growth. Kazakhstan 's transition to the innovation type of development can be conditionally divided into two stages. The beginning of the first stage is connected with adoption of the Strategy of industrial-innovation development in 2003, formation of the institutional base and the key moments of the national innovation system. In 2010, having adopted the State program of forced industrial-innovation development of the country for 2010-2014 there began the stage of accelerated building of the innovation economy, strengthening of legislative and financial stimulation of the innovation activity. At present the efforts of the state innovation policy are aimed to, firstly, the development of innovation clusters and innovation environment, secondly, the increase of the innovation infrastructure efficiency, thirdly, the development of principally new system of scientific-technological developments' commercialization. Up to 2015 the main priority trends of the state policy on the country's forced industrialization will become realization of innovation-investment projects in traditional export-oriented sectors of economy. The main accent will be made on development of new instruments of the state-private partnership in the sphere of innovations development, as well as target technological programs for co-funding prospective research.

Using a new dataset on international partnerships in China and India in three key low carbon technologies solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and coal gasification/integrated gasification combined cycle and complementary expert interviews we study the dynamics of the transfer of intellectual property and the underlying drivers that guide the development of business strategies and partnerships in the context of transitioning intellectual property regimes in emerging markets. We find that weak intellectual property regimes are indeed a hindrance to the diffusion of certain classes of low carbon technologies: (i) for cutting-edge technologies, (ii) for fully-embodied (explicitly codified) technologies, and (iii) for small firms. However, we also find that intellectual property issues do not represent a barrier to the diffusion of the relatively mature and low to medium cost low carbon technologies that are materially (at scale) most important for carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the short to medium term. Competitive technology supply, shifting market dynamics, and increasingly vigorous domestic innovation coupled with mechanisms and opportunities to structure credible intellectual property deals allow for the diffusion of key low carbon technologies to occur within the context of existing business, political, and institutional structures.

This article combines the technological innovation system (TIS) functions, within the transitions framework, with policy analysis to empirically map multiple policies and their intended paths towards low-carbon transport systems. Empirically, the article provides a systematic review of Finnish national-level policies for transport and transport-related innovation. The discussion examines the contribution of the current policy mix to sustainability transitions based on its degree of attempt to re-design the transport system. The findings reveal that policy support is more comprehensive regarding more energy-efficient vehicles and low-carbon fuels than based on reduced transport demand or alternative transport modes.

    <att name="AB" value="In this article, we reflect on how patents of introduction or importation, which compose an institutional policy related to weak IPR systems, could influence long-term international technology transfer. Both theoretically and empirically, the consequences of strengthening IPRs in lagging economies for technology transfer and innovation remain unclear. Although the mainstream literature tends to link stronger patent enforcement with better invention and innovation markets now and in the past, new theoretical and historical evidence supports extreme complexity in the relationship between IPR extension and scope and technological diffusion. For the first time, in this study, we analyze a large series of patents of introduction, which were a common feature of the early stages of almost all patent systems designed to favor technology transfer and innovation above original inventor property rights. Though typically used by pioneers, followers, and latecomers, we know little of how they functioned and their consequences. In this study, we analyze the use of patents of introduction throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Spain, which was a lagging country on the European periphery. The results demonstrate that this institutional policy could facilitate technology transfer, innovation, and advancement at earlier stages of industrialization. As additional research has demonstrated, such evidence may have serious implications for IPR treatment in both developing and underdeveloped economies." />

Taking advantage of the patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China from 1985 to 2010, this paper examined innovation performance in the Chinese ICT industry with the help of bibliometric techniques. The analysis has been conducted from several perspectives, including the trend and character of patent outputs, the most prolific Chinese regions and their changes, the primary innovators and their type of institutions, and the collaboration among university (U)-industry (I)-research institutes (R). The results show that the great importance that the government and domestic enterprises attach to technology R&amp;D and patent protection has brought significant improvements in the Chinese ICT sector, and enterprises have thus gradually become the main body of technological innovation in recent years. In terms of U-I-R collaborations, I-I collaborations are the most popular pattern, followed by U-I and I-R collaborations. In the last 20 years or so, U-I-R collaborations have improved, but they are still weak. In the future, U-I-R collaborations should be further reinforced, and more universities and research institutes should be encouraged to become involved in U-I-R collaborations to help enterprises enhance their innovative capabilities." />

An optimum academic entrepreneurship and technology-transfer regime matches various levels of inventor interest and involvement with appropriate organizational competence and support. The 'Paradox of Success' is that great organizational success in licensing, or other activities, may reduce the motivation to further advancement, in the Stanford case, introducing support structures for research commercialization that are commonplace in aspiring entrepreneurial universities. Stanford had largely bought into an ideology of a self-organizing innovation ecosystem in Silicon Valley that implied lack of need for explicit entrepreneurial support structures on campus, such as incubator facilities. This belief inhibited policy intervention until a student-organized accelerator project actualizing underutilized entrepreneurial capacity demonstrated that a step change in promoting entrepreneurship at Stanford was necessary and feasible.

In earlier decades, the international transfer of technology was an important factor in Japan's rise to become one of the leading industrialised nations. Today, however, the focus is on the interregional and intraregional transfer of technology between research institutions and private firms when addressing the issue of national and regional competitiveness. Regional innovation policies, in particular those under the responsibility of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and its regional bureaus, have for several years been making a great effort to promote the intraregional transfer of technology and business start-ups. This paper investigates the structure, the spatial reach and the innovation performance of R&amp;D networks that have built up as part of a regional development programme financed by METI. A social network analysis is carried out using a unique data set of joint research projects of public research institutions, private firms and government institutions. The results show that the spatial patterns of R&amp;D networks depend on the technical field of the research projects as well as on the role of the parties involved. Academia-academia cooperations have a much greater spatial reach than cooperations with private firms. The public sector plays an important role in local innovation processes." />

This paper provides insight into the development of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (HFCT) in Iran (1993-2010), as an alternative for increasing sustainability of energy system in long-term. This is done by applying the Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach and studying the structure and dynamics of seven key processes that affect the formation of HFCT TIS. Thereafter, the pattern of HFCT development in Iran is compared with the Netherlands, using a multi-level perspective. Then, it is shown that under-development and oil-dependency, which are two macro-economic factors at landscape level, can explain the main differences between these countries at regime and niche levels. This means that macro-economic factors cause Iran and the Netherlands to experience different ways for the development of HFCT. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

This framework allows this research to diagnose the roles and relations of regional innovation institutions and define the characteristics of the innovation models for science parks in South Korea and Taiwan; subsequently, this research quantitatively measures two regional university-industry-government network densities to find collaborative knowledge generation. Second, network centrality is measured in order to analyse the regional innovation participations' roles of collaboration. Finally, the status of cluster performance is qualitatively compared and related to collaboration networks.

In this paper, two fields are analyzed: the life sciences industry and the solar energy industry to evaluate the Finnish innovation policy's capabilities to promote emerging industries. Qualitative research methods are used for this exploratory study. The data consists of 29 semi-structured interviews and two workshops. The interviewees were chosen with snowball sampling. The data is analyzed using a scheme of functional technological innovation system analysis to identify blocking and inducement mechanisms within the industries. The performance of key processes (functions) of the life sciences and solar energy innovation systems are evaluated. Functional analysis is used to identify underlying mechanisms which induce and hinder system performances. Many similar mechanisms are found to affect both of the industries. Limited commercial experience, scarce venture capital, weak local and global networks, and poor legitimation hinder their development. High-level research and education, good infrastructure, and public R&amp;D support are identified as promoting mechanisms. According to the results, Finnish innovation policy performs insufficiently in facilitating the growth of new industries. We suggest that in addition to the general innovation policy measures, technology-specific measures should be designed to create growth trajectories for emerging technologies. New communication and knowledge exchange channels are needed to support these trajectories." />

The research develops a taxonomy that could make a significant impact on accurate nanotechnology patent data quests and increases the reliability of the analyses. The findings show that significant linkages of the U. S., Korean, and Japanese actors appear as being highly centralized around key players within their own national innovation systems. The results suggest that strengthening the linkages between scientific and corporate actors may eliminate many barriers and accelerate the diffusion of technology into the commercialized stage.

Therefore, a proper infrastructure for MEEMS needs to be effectively applied in order to implement policy initiatives. A novel organisational framework of MEEMS is proposed and is constituted upon three pillars: integration of the municipal metabolism approach, the KBS (knowledge-based system), and the MTIS (municipal technology innovation system). By properly addressing the dynamics of the MEES (municipal energy and environmental system), and the new conceptual organisation of MEEMS, a need for the inclusion of innovative elements can be defined regarding support mechanisms. Integration of the end-user approach defines the fundamental orientation of modern MEEMS. This new concept paves a pathway towards an intelligent energy and environmental system.

While there has been much research into producing fuel from algae, a commercial-scale facility has not yet been built. We examine two case studies of energy technology innovation in the United States, first generation biodiesel and solar photovoltaics (PV), using the technological innovation system (TIS) framework to provide lessons and inform the path forward for commercializing algal biofuel. We identify five event types that have been the most influential to these innovation processes: changing expectations, technology development, demonstration projects, policy targets, and government subsidies. Some algal biofuel demonstration projects have occurred, but despite falling under the mandates set forth in the RFS (a policy target), algal biofuels do not currently receive production subsidies. The main finding from the case study analysis is that government interventions have significantly influenced the innovation processes of first generation biodiesel and solar PV and will likely be key factors in the commercialization of algal biofuel.

It can contribute to policy objectives on climate change, energy security, green growth and social progress. However, the large potential of offshore wind does not automatically lead to a large share in future energy systems; neither does the emergent stage of development of the technology. Recent insights in innovation studies suggest that the success chances of technological innovations are, to a large extent, determined by how the surrounding system the innovation system is built up and how it functions. In this paper we assess the offshore wind innovation systems of four countries: Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands and Germany with the objective to provide recommendations for strengthening the overall European offshore wind innovation system. We use the Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach to analyse the system in 2011. Based on the analysis we identify a number of challenges that the European offshore wind sector faces. Some of them include: a serious deficiency of engineers; fragmented policies and poor alignment of national regulatory frameworks; cost of the technology and limited grid infrastructure. Since the problems hinder the entire system development we call for a systemic policy instrument that would support the innovation system around this technology and contribute to its wider diffusion in Europe.

The framework is built from previous references that we use to explicitly link the features of Proof of Concept Centers with the challenges of the Proof of Concept phase, and establish their specific contributions to the overall technology commercialization efforts of a university. We illustrate the application of this framework in a case study of the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, and develop a characterization that is representative of the role that a Proof of Concept Center can play in comparable university ecosystems that feature conventional technology commercialization structures, and struggle with the challenges of the Proof of Concept phase. Our study suggests that there is in fact a possible role for a Proof of Concept Center in the regional ecosystem of the University of Coimbra, with a potentially very relevant impact in the technology commercialization process, through networking outside academia and research environments, funding of Proof of Concept activities, and technology entrepreneurship education for the development of entrepreneurial skills for researchers." />

The Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework presents a list of system functions for the analysis of the development of a technology. It has often been applied to renewable energy technologies, but with a strong focus on advanced economies. In this paper, we elaborate on emerging economy innovation system formation, structured according to TIS functions. Rather than analysing development of the technology, we analyse the development of the Chinese TIS vis-a-vis the global forefront. Key to this notion is that TIS, especially for clean-tech, are transnational phenomena. Lagging TIS depend on the global TIS, whereas leading TIS contribute to its formation. It is concluded that China has reduced its dependence on foreign knowledge and investment, but the outward contribution remains limited. The main challenge to foreign market expansion lies in reforming the domestic TIS to focus on turbine quality rather than cost reduction. Demonstration projects are needed, especially for large capacity and offshore turbine models, in order to build up operational history and get quality certification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="This special issue reflects on innovation and industrial policy from the premise that economic growth can be based on the permanent transformation of an economic system via the emergence and/or transformation of multi-agent structures and their inherent competences and knowledge base. The process of emergence or transformation is conceived as being the result of entrepreneurial effort, or entrepreneurs reacting to external stimuli in a way that takes advantage of an evolving knowledge base. The same process, however, can be undermined by both market and institutional failures. Past research has clearly indicated the importance of institutional structures for innovation, but also that structures as they exist may not be ideal: some institutions involved in innovation may provide the wrong incentives, faulty information, or allocate insufficient resources to accomplish their goals or mandates; and they may fail to reduce uncertainty. The paper asks whether and how a targeted, co-evolutionary approach can help overcome a lack of dynamic coordination and other failures that originate in coincidence with the emergence of a complex form of industrial organisation, be it an innovation system, cluster or a new industrial sector. More specifically, it builds upon the extended industry life cycle (EILC) model and the notion of evolutionary targeting to explore the potential benefits (and drawbacks) of targeting biotechnology innovation systems (BISs)." />

However, based on data on publications produced in 2006-2009 at the Neutron Science Directorate of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee (United States), we find that internationalization of its collaborative research is restrained by coordination costs similar to those characterizing other institutional settings. Policies mandating LSRFs should consider that research prioritized on the basis of technological relevance limits the international reach of collaborations. Additionally, the propensity for international collaboration is lower for resident scientists than for those affiliated with domestic universities or government laboratories. Policies conceiving LSRFs as knowledge attractors therefore should consider the complementarities between research at a LSRF and in its academic context at a regional or national level." />

We use the Taiwanese pharmaceutical biotechnology policies as empirical cases. On the basis of the empirical cases of Taiwan, we find that the consistency and appropriateness of RTDI policies are shaped by four variables: polity, horizontal coordination, vertical coordination and the involvement of external stakeholders.

It is argued that the types of problems confronted by an innovation system, and in turn its dynamics of change, are imprinted on the nature of the underlying knowledge bases. The latter is operationalized through the construction of co-citation networks from scientific publications. We endow these co-citation networks with directionality through the allocation of a particular problem, drawn from a 'problem space' for nanomaterials, to each network node. By analyzing the longitudinal, structural and cognitive changes undergone by these problem-attached networks, we attempt to infer the nature of the paths of change of emerging nanotechnological innovation systems.

Critical reviews of key literature in both knowledge management and organization theory identified four organizational knowledge dilemmas - &quot;silos of knowledge&quot;, &quot;tragedy of the knowledge commons&quot;, &quot;knowledge friction&quot; and &quot;knowledge toxicity&quot;. These dilemmas were used in various combinations to generate five commonly occurring scenarios in organizations. A game theoretic analysis of these scenarios using the PARTS framework provided a useful understanding of knowledge flows within organizational eco-systems. More specifically, the analysis led to key insights and prescriptive guiding principles in formulating knowledge strategies and policies to combat the major knowledge dilemmas that inhibit effective knowledge flows within organizations.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper deals with knowledge flows and collaboration between firms in the regional innovation system of southern Sweden. The aim is to analyse how the functional and spatial organization of knowledge interdependencies among firms and other actors varies between different types of industries that draw on different types of knowledge bases. We use data from three case studies of firm clusters in the region: (1) the life science cluster represents an analytical (science-based) industry, (2) the food cluster includes mainly synthetic (engineering-based) industries, and (3) the moving media cluster is considered to be symbolic (artistic based). Knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange in each of the cases are explored and compared using social network analysis in association with data gathered through interviews with firm representatives. Our findings reveal that knowledge exchange in geographical proximity is especially important for industries that rely on a symbolic or synthetic knowledge base, because the interpretation of the knowledge they deal with tends to differ between places. This is less the case for industries drawing on an analytical knowledge base, which rely more on scientific knowledge that is codified, abstract and universal and are therefore less sensitive to geographical distance. Thus, geographical clustering of firms in analytical industries builds on rationales other than the need for proximity for knowledge sourcing." />

In the US, FTA has been used to create visionary concepts and to promote cooperation between and among agencies, departments of the federal government, academia, and stakeholders. In Germany PTA has mainly been used to shape and define research and innovation agendas of established science industry networks. The aim of the paper is to show what problems/challenges with regard to the innovation system have been addressed and what main actors have been involved, from the first monitoring and forecasting studies on nanotechnology to the establishment of national nanotechnology programs and continuing on until today. The paper offers a comparative analysis of the use and role of FTA where the focus is not on individual activities, but rather on the longer-term interplay between the organizational settings in both countries and the future-oriented nanotechnology analysis. In countries such as the US and Germany, where FTA on nanotechnology were already underway in the late 1980s, the early stages of FTA relied on expert-based methods such as technology intelligence and technology forecasting to define the field and to explore what could happen in general. Participatory formats such as dialogues on ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA) became more important only later on. Especially the inter-organizational setting can be considered a crucial condition for maximizing the impact that participatory PTA can have in the future governance of nanotechnology.

The conclusions are: first, policies should go beyond market pull' and technology push' and should take into account the institutional frameworks through which they are delivered; second, policies have been more successful where they prioritised long-term learning-oriented deployment rather than short-term efficiency; third, system failures exist at the transfer stage of development as well as during formative and growth phases." />

    <att name="AB" value="Conducting national Foresight studies has become common in many countries. However the impact of such studies on the performance of the national innovation system remains unclear. The paper therefore assesses the impact of national Foresight studies conducted in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Research Area (ERA). The study provides a first indication of the impact of national Foresight studies on the performance of national innovation systems. However the findings so far are preliminary since input data reflect long term developments of national innovation systems. Thus a long term study of the impacts of national Foresight studies is essential. In the short term, it can be concluded that national Foresight studies contribute significantly to the design and in some countries reshape of the innovation system structure and framework conditions. A direct quantitative measurement of the impact and thus the value of Foresight studies cannot yet be done in a statistically reliable fashion. However the changes these studies have caused within the national innovation systems may have an indirect impact on the future national innovation performance. Most recently national Foresight studies have switched from a rather exclusive focus on technology trend assessments towards more integrated holistic approaches identifying future challenges for society and economy as a whole thus deriving strengths and weaknesses of the national scientific, research and technology base to meet these challenges long term in the most appropriate way.

Hardware enjoys higher barriers to entry, which the Chinese companies are increasingly reinforcing with intellectual property investments. In addition to being better integrated with the global economy, they are also buttressed by the huge domestic market. The overdependence of Indian firms on selling low-value services to a few countries and insulation from domestic demand make them vulnerable to emerging competition and international economic ill-winds.

However, little attention has been given to the innovation activities of the Chinese wind industry. In our paper, we aim to address this gap, based on second-hand sources and over 50 personal interviews with wind energy-related experts. We argue that China's wind industry has made great progress in terms of manufacturing and installing, but is confronted with various challenges and problems regarding the development of its indigenous innovation capabilities. Using innovation systems approaches as an analytical tool and focusing on institutions, actors, technology and their interaction in supporting innovation activities, we decompose the elements of China's wind energy innovation system and their role in developing the domestic wind industry. Against this backdrop we identify and discuss challenges and obstacles in the development of an innovation-driven wind industry in China. The paper strongly argues that more attention should be paid to improve the coordination and cooperation among the various actors of the wind energy innovation system, to the build-up of a market-oriented education and training system as well as to intellectual property protection.

Within this system, key socio-political components, including institutions, actor-networks, and technology development, are examined to evaluate the state of the innovation system. The study assessed the perceived capacity of seven functional areas of the CCS innovation system through a survey of key CCS actors and stakeholders. The findings suggest that China's CCS innovation system has a strong functional capacity for knowledge and technology development. It is significantly weaker in the innovative functions of knowledge diffusion, market formation, facilitating entrepreneurs and new entrants into the CCS market.

Applying a new version of the 'technological innovation system' framework to nanotechnology in Sweden, we find a rich pattern of impact, including substantial 'commercialisation'. However, the effect of academic activities is constrained by factors exogenous to academia, in particular a lack of knowledge about environmental and health risks, institutional and market uncertainties, poorly coordinated policies and insufficient access to innovation-related capital.

Firms and other actors collaborate in formal networks not only to generate new knowledge but also to strategically create and shape supportive system resources such as technology specific R&amp;D programs. This paper takes a closer look at the resources, which are developed and deployed by networks to facilitate the building up of a TIS. Networks rely not only on the organizational resources of their members but also on new resources developed at the network level including network governance structures, trust among network members, a common understanding of the strategic goals or a good reputation of the network. Our analysis shows that the capacity of networks to fulfill different tasks of system building especially depends on the network resources they are able to establish. With the differentiation of organizational, network and system resources we introduce a conceptual framework, which makes three important contributions. It highlights the strategic nature of (innovation) system building; it allows us comparing the contribution of different actors and formal networks in this regard; and it improves our understanding of how firm and system level processes are intertwined.

We examine how different kinds of organizations contributed and responded to a recent hype and disappointment cycle in the field of stationary fuel cells. Among others, we trace how innovation and discourse activities changed and we explain the observed differences in strategic responses. We show that the sensitivity of organizations to expectation dynamics depends on at least three factors: the strategic embedding of the new technology, the organization's dependence on external legitimacy and its role in the innovation system. Moreover, we show that - in their aggregation - strategic responses affected the level of the technological innovation system as well. Not only did the pace and direction of innovation activities change, but structures such as actor constellations and institutions were also modified. Our study thus provides insights into the interplay of expectation and innovation dynamics, which is important for our understanding of larger transformation processes, e.g. toward more sustainable modes of energy supply.

    <att name="AB" value="As is the case in several other countries of the Middle East and North Africa region, fossil energy resources have long dominated Tunisia's energy sector. However, concerns about depleting fossil fuels, rising prices, and growing demand have driven interest in the country's substantial but largely untapped solar energy resources. In 2005, the Tunisian government, with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme, launched PROSOL, an innovative financing scheme to revitalize an anemic solar water heater (SWH) market. PROSOL has been a resounding success, which has spurred similar policy initiatives in neighboring countries. On the basis of in-depth reviews of project progress reports, external evaluations, and stakeholder interviews, we analyze Tunisia's experience with the PROSOL initiative with a view to extracting practical lessons that might inform replication in other developing countries. Drawing on the concept of a technological innovation system (TIS), we isolate and address key questions including: why and how public and private agents may either support or hamper a given technological innovation; and how, in the Tunisian case, new SWH interest groups and networks emerge around new technology initiatives such as PROSOL. Our findings highlight the central role of public policy in removing barriers to the market diffusion of proven renewable energy technologies. In the Tunisian case, the establishment by law of a substantial capital cost subsidy while exempting SWHs from value added tax and decreasing custom duties enabled SWH systems to compete effectively against conventional energy sources such as natural gas or liquid petroleum gas. The study also confirms the importance of capacity building, buttressed by an effective communication and outreach strategy, targeting key actors including government policy makers, the national utility, financial institutions, and SWH vendors.

Much of the nature and effects of such collaboration are, as one would expect, counterintuitive and highlight the care we should place on assessing the role of universities and other HEIs in open innovation systems." />

    <att name="AB" value="Systemic policy instruments are receiving increased attention among innovation scholars as a means to stimulate sustainability oriented technological innovation. The instruments are called systemic in the expectation that they will improve the functioning of entire (innovation) systems. A first step in designing systemic instruments is an analysis of the systemic problems that hinder the development of a specific technological trajectory. This paper argues that two approaches to studying innovation systems-structural and functional analyses-can be combined in a systemic policy framework that helps to first, identify the systemic problems; and second, to suggest the systemic instruments that would address these problems." />

    <att name="AB" value="This paper provides an empirical analysis of the technology market for patents in Japan, by using a novel firm-level dataset that combines a Japanese Patent Office survey titled Survey of Intellectual Property Activities, the Institute of Intellectual Property patent database, and the Licensing Activity Survey conducted by the University of Tokyo. In this paper, we use a two-step model to estimate a firm's licensing propensities; the first step estimates the determinants of potential licensors (willingness to license) and the second step identifies the factors of the actual licensing out of technology (licensing propensity). We found that a significant number of patents held by firms are not licensed out, although the owners are willing to do so. Our econometric analysis reveals that a major factor behind this technology market imperfection is the potential licensors' difficulty in finding licensing partners. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

    <att name="AB" value="This paper examines a number of forces that have possibly contributed to the explosive growth of Chinese patenting over the past decade. After a review of previous hypotheses and conventional wisdom, this study proposes an additional explanation and argues that patent subsidy programs implemented by each provincial region have played an important role in the growth of Chinese patenting. This institutional change, taking place at the province-level, has induced an increase in patent propensity among not only firms, universities, and research institutes, but also individuals. Empirical evidence based on publicly available data provides solid support for this argument. It was also found that a larger fraction of applications are granted patent rights since the implementation of such programs, suggesting that reduction in patent application quality may not be a serious concern, unless the criteria used for patent examination have been lowered.

    <att name="AB" value="For the last two hundred years, neo-classical economics has recognized only two factors of production: labor and capital. But, nowadays information and knowledge are replacing capital and energy as the primary wealth-creating assets. Technological developments have transformed wealth-creating work from physically-based to knowledge based. Technology, knowledge as well as innovation are now the key factors of production. Knowledge economy is economy based on creating, evaluating, and trading knowledge. In a knowledge economy, labour costs become progressively less important and traditional economic concepts such as scarcity of resources and economies of scale of economy cease to apply. The most valuable asset of the 21st-century institution, either business or non-business, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity. Knowledge workers' productivity is the biggest of the 21st century management challenges. In the developed countries, it is their first survival requirement. Making knowledge workers productive requires changes in attitude, not only on the part of the individual knowledge worker but also on the part of the whole organization. (Drucker, 1999, in http://www.knowledgeworkerperformance.com). Creating knowledge relates to the education system, which creates knowledge workers and innovation system, for example soft skills (worker behaviour), Positive Psychological Capital (Luthan et. al, 2007), and hard skill such as ICT literacy. The innovation system, which contributes to innovativeness, in any country, consists of institutions, rules, and procedures that affect how the system acquires, creates, disseminates, and uses knowledge. The objectives of this research are to develop a conceptual model which describse the relationship among the soft skills of knowledge workers, hard skills of knowledge workers, innovativeness of knowledge workers in the context of knowledge economy in Indonesia as a developing country. Multiple Regression Analysis was used as a method for this research. The conceptual model was designed with independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are hard skills, information seeking hard skills, concept thinking soft skills, and self efficacy - positive psychological capital. The dependent variables are: technical innovativeness (product and services) and non-technical innovativeness (organization and marketing). Only one company as the subject of this research which becomes the limitation of the study. The research findings are that only information seeking soft skill that positively influnced technical innovativeness and only hard skills that positively influenced non-technical innovativeness.

In particular, it analyses the extent to which organisational and locational factors are associated with the nature of these networks. Based on a UK-wide survey of universities, it is shown that the nature and formation of inter-organisational knowledge networks is related principally to the organisational characteristics of network actors, and secondarily to their spatial location. The characteristics of a network actor, in this case a university, are likely to influence the type, diversity and location of other actors with which it networks. Nevertheless, spatial location is an important secondary factor influencing network formation, especially the geographic reach of a university's network. It is further found that the value generated by universities from their knowledge networks is associated with the type of organisations within which they interact as well as their spatial location. It is concluded that such networks impact both regional innovation capability and regional competitiveness. The results have implications for policymakers, especially in terms of the spatial scale at which the demand and supply for university knowledge can be best mediated." />

The programme contributes to reducing the agency problems of adverse selections and moral hazards in the relationships between the government and the actors that are involved in the commercialization of research. Key tasks include collecting and sharing information, engaging in long-term relationships with principals and agents, developing strategies and specific contractual relationships, taking higher risks for risk-averse agents and using multiple indicators. The programme also plays an institutional role by reducing goal conflicts.

    <att name="Z9" value="1" />
    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on the evaluation model of the enterprises' technological innovation system, based on the theory of complex adaptive system. Design/methodology/approach - Combined with the status quo and recent studies of Chinese enterprises' technological innovation, the paper discusses the complex-system features of the technological innovation. The stimulus-response model is used to establish the two-level framework for enterprises' technological innovation system. By means of the adaptive fitness function, the economic and social utility of enterprises' technological innovation is measured from two dimensions. Finally, the fuzzy catastrophe model is introduced to evaluate the enterprises' technological innovation. Findings - The enterprises' technological innovation system has attributions of the subject aggregation, the systematic openness, nonlinearity and diversity. Thus, the macro-micro based technological innovation system from the perspective of complex adaptive system is proposed. The system utility is considered based on the system subjects and system structure, and the calculation framework of the adaptive fitness for the whole system is obtained by considering the emergent property describing the system scale effect and structure effect. In fact, the fuzzy theory can well reflect the influential situation that the interactions between different factors may cause the mutation of the higher level and the interactions between enterprises can lead to the shifts of the system. Originality/value - The paper proposes the complex adaptive system for the enterprises' technological innovation based on the special macro environment in China. A new framework for the research of technological innovation is provided by analyzing the system inner model. Fuzzy catastrophe model can reduce the evaluation irrationality due to the subjective index weights." />

Such firms follow more informal guidelines in the development and evolution of their relationships with universities. However, a specific sector of firms in the region reveals a collaboration strategy characterized by the development of diverse types of activities with universities: they involve in more intensive generation and use of scientific knowledge and more formal processes of relationships.

    <att name="AB" value="In the context of widespread agrarian distress in rural India, finding ways to secure livelihood sustainability of small farmers have become urgent concerns. Agroecological methods (AEMs) are considered by some to be effective in solving structural problems with farmers' production processes engendered by the use of resource-intensive technologies. AEMs generally require extensive participation by farmers for further development through on-farm experimentation and collective learning. This article studies learning through the lens of knowledge circulation between farmers and &quot;experts&quot; in a local innovation system. In particular it analyzes farmers' participation in knowledge circulation using network data on problem-solving knowledge flows to and from an innovative south Indian village. The findings suggest that farmers' participation was restricted by formal and informal institutions governing the knowledge interactions between the development organizations that promoted AEM and the farmers. Any new ways of working (technological and institutional innovations) are argued to be filtered through the sediments of extant techno-institutional context, leading to the profusion of hybrid forms of technology and organization. However, despite this profusion, or perhaps because of it, epistemological and sociocultural hierarchies continue to operate in avowedly participatory projects organized to promote AEMs based on farmers' &quot;traditional knowledge.&quot;" />

The conceptual basis for assessing such &quot;leapfrogging&quot; potentials is however still rather weakly developed. The present paper elaborates an encompassing conceptual framework drawing on the technological innovation systems literature and adding an explicit geographical focus that embeds an NIC's innovation system in its international context. From this, we derive six ideal-type leapfrogging trajectories. The framework is applied to the case of a potential transition to onsite wastewater treatment in China. Empirical evidence is based on 30 expert interviews with representatives from companies, universities, authorities and associations in China and Europe. Our results suggest that leapfrogging in the Chinese wastewater sector might develop in either an integrated &quot;international innovation system&quot; trajectory, where Chinese and international actors closely interact or in an &quot;international competition&quot; trajectory, where Chinese actors endogenously build up technological leadership in strong competition to international actors. We conclude by outlining policy implications and by discussing future research priorities for leapfrogging and transition studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="AB" value="Innovations are the driving force for agricultural development under present diverse situations of uncertainty. The innovation system perspective acknowledges the contributions made by all stakeholders involved in knowledge development, dissemination and appropriation. According to the specific agricultural production system, farmers adopt innovations, modify them or innovate on their own. This paper examines the role of farmers' experiments and innovations in Cuba's agricultural innovation system (AIS), identifies knowledge exchange encounters and describes some strategies implemented to institutionalize farmers' experiments and innovations. The research methods comprised 34 semi-structured interviews with agricultural experts from the science, administration and advisory system, and 31 free list questionnaires to assess the institutional influence on farmers' experiments and innovations. In addition, three case studies of outstanding farmers' experiments are presented. The results suggest that the government's commitment to social participation in knowledge development provides the basic prerequisite for an effective integration of farmers' experiments and innovation in Cuba. The historically conditioned vertical structure of knowledge development and dissemination is gradually changing toward more horizontal procedures. The dynamic exchange of ideas at all kinds of interactive meetings, such as workshops or farmers' field schools, have favored farmer to farmer learning as well as knowledge sharing with research, academic and extension officials. This multi-stakeholders' approach contributes to institutionalize farmers' knowledge. Farmers' experiments and innovations play a major role in improving farm management and thereby can contribute to build resilience at the farming system level as well as for the national agricultural system." />

These include DARPA's ability to undertake multigenerational technology thrusts, the synergies it has been able to create through complementary strategic technologies, its ability to build an advocate community, and connections it has built to larger innovation elements downstream from DARPA. It has also taken on incumbent technologies within both DOD and in the private sector, used ties to DOD leadership to press its advances, and supported initial market creation. The article then reviews the new ARPA-E model in detail, commenting first on how ARPA-E has adopted key DARPA approaches. It then discusses new features ARPA-E is adopting, driven by the unique demands of the complex, established energy sector. These include new ways: (1) to sharpen the research visioning, selection and support processes, (2) to build a community of support, important to its political survival, and (3) to implement technologies it supports. In addition, the further DARPA features enumerated above provide potentially useful future guideposts to ARPA-E. The paper closes with a discussion of the difficult technology implementation problems on the &quot;back end&quot; of the innovation system-including demonstrations, test beds, and initial markets.

Using Chinese patent data in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this paper examines the geographic variations in intraregional, inter-regional and international knowledge exchanges of China from 1985 to 2007. Degree centrality reveals that intraregional and international collaborations are the main channels of knowledge exchange for the provinces and municipalities of China while inter-regional knowledge exchange is relatively weak. Besides, over the two decades, the knowledge exchange network has been expanding (connecting an increasing number of provinces and countries), becoming more decentralized (increasing number of hubs) and more cohesive (more linkages). A blockmodel analysis further reveals that the inter-regional network of China begins to show characteristics of a core-periphery structure. The most active knowledge exchange occurs between members of the core block composed by the most advanced provinces while the members of the peripheral block from less favored regions have few or no local and extra-local knowledge exchange. Building a strong knowledge transfer network would much improve the innovation capacities in less favored regions and help them break out from their &quot;locked-in&quot; development trajectories." />

The empirical study investigates how innovation systems evolve in natural resource industries through analysing the co-evolution between industry, knowledge organisations and national policy in the Norwegian aluminium and petroleum sectors. Parallels are found in the development of these two sectors, which are: (i) the deliberate use of concession laws to seize value creation and technological development from foreign direct investments, (ii) the establishment and prioritisation of state-owned companies and (iii) the more or less intentional formation of a national innovation system. The paper points to the relevance of analysing the historical evolution of national innovation systems to understand the creation of their specific path-dependent characteristics, to analyse how policy influences the creation and working of innovation systems, to use a multilevel approach in studies of innovation systems and to consider how innovation processes in different industries are linked in value chains and through knowledge flows.

    <att name="AB" value="The paper presents selected results of the social evaluation of the Croatian innovation system (HIS) based on the thesis that, in Croatia, Vie can talk about the systemic failures of the innovation system, which leads to backwardness in technology and competitiveness. The aim of research was to explore barriers to achieving the goals of the first innovation programme focused on supporting the technological projects (TEST programme) and, based on these findings, to figure out the systemic deficiencies of the whole innovation system. The Research was conducted by a questionnaire survey targeted at the leaders of the TEST projects and examines their attitudes towards a range of dimensions of the programme which are essential components of social evaluation of this segment of the innovation policy. Currently, there is lack of evaluations that would assess the role and impact of innovation programmes for science and technology policy in relation to socio-cultural surroundings and historical heritage in which authors find their motive for such an investigation. The study found that implementation of TEST resulted, besides intended consequences, in variety of unintended and failed consequences which change the programme focus from research commercialization, as the main goal, into generating scientific results that mostly serve the needs of the scientists for continuation of their scientific projects. Institutional deficits of the formal and informal character, followed by the broader socio-cultural context, are found to be among main drivers of unintended and failed consequences. The paper concludes that the most of the projects were caught in sort of a &quot;backward loop&quot; that moves from the scientific ideas and after an attempt of technological application and commercialisation returned to their starting points - the application of scientific appliance. Although TEST brought many organizational and cultural novelties to scientific policy, results suggest a need for thorough reform of innovation policy - from one based exclusively on scientific research into one focused on existing needs and capacities of companies." />

This article proposes a differentiation of context structures as a crucial step in the analysis of technological innovation systems. A thorough context analysis, so the argument, is essential for understanding the pace and direction of technology development and the prospects of an emerging technological innovation system. Empirical insights are provided for Bio-SNG, a technology in an early stage of development. The article discusses the conditions under which actors from different sectors (forestry, wood industry, and energy supply) may play a role in the emerging field. It is shown that Bio-SNG is likely to become a victim of the recent boom in wood-to-energy technologies that has favored investments in more mature but technologically inferior alternatives. The case provides lessons for policy making as it highlights how effective support schemes might foster a lock-in into technologies that are readily available. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we study the role of formal networks in creating supportive structures in the technological innovation system for stationary fuel cells in Germany. Our findings are based on an in-depth study of five selected innovation networks. The analysis shows that the networks were strategically set up to support the creation of a variety of elements including public R&amp;D programs, modules for vocational training, technical guidelines, standardized components, or a positive image of the technology. These elements have been reported to generate positive externalities in the field, e.g. as they help to establish user-supplier linkages in the emerging value chain. We conclude that, from a firm perspective such elements may represent strategically relevant resources made available at the innovation system level. This view opens up a link to the literature of strategic management, thus highlighting the importance of strategic action and cooperation in emerging technological fields. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Overlooked in such analyses are important connections between universities and academic hospitals, and the non-commercial aspects of translational science. The two types of institutions tend to be collapsed into a single entity-'the university'-and relational flows are lost. Yet the distinctions and flows between the two are crucial elements of translational science and the biomedical innovation system. This paper explores what has been called the 'hidden research system' that connects hospitals, universities, and their resources, with the clinical and scientific actors who make the linkages possible. Then, using a novel conceptual model of translational science, we examine the individual interactions and dynamics involved in a particular example of the biomedical innovation system at work: the diagnosis of IRAK-4 deficiency, a rare immunological disorder, and the translational flows that result. Contra to conventional IS analyses, we are able to point to the strong role of public-sector institutions, and the weak role of the private-sector, in the translational processes described here.

    <att name="AB" value="In knowledge-based sectors such as ICT innovation is seen to be as a key factor for the competitiveness of firms. Nowadays, the innovation process is regarded to be highly interactive, so companies tend to rely on both internal and external knowledge. There are arguments that the character of knowledge and innovation links depends to a large extent on the density and the institutional setting of the respective regional innovation system (RIS). We investigate, therefore, whether firms in a metropolitan and non-metropolitan RIS exhibit different ways and patterns to source knowledge relevant for innovation. We expect that ICT companies in a metropolitan RIS such as Vienna rely to a much higher extent on local knowledge sources in particular from universities and research organizations. For firms in a non-metropolitan RIS, such as Salzburg, we expect a higher reliance on distant knowledge links with a variety of partners. At the beginning, we provide a conceptual frame, by introducing the concept of knowledge bases and a typology of knowledge links applying these to the innovation process in the ICT sector. Then we present some empirical evidence for ICT companies in the regions of Vienna, representing a metropolitan RIS with a high density of knowledge organizations and firms, and Salzburg standing for a non-metropolitan RIS with a lower size and density of such organizations. We analyse the types of knowledge sources, the channels of knowledge exchange and the spatial level of these interactions. In the final section, we will draw some policy conclusions." />

This re-orientation poses different challenges to regions, and the regional innovation system (RIS) concept may be the central element, simultaneously goal and toolbox, for devising innovation-promotion policies. The RIS framework stresses the need to combine a systemic and inclusive view of innovation along with territorially embedded specificities. In this paper, we explore how to operationalize the concept of RIS in terms of innovation policy, arguing against a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach. Concentrating our analysis on follower regions, we bridge the concept of RIS with the structural deficiencies and challenges posing to this kind of regions, for which innovation policy should seek an adequate combination between science-push and demand-pull perspectives. We also address the importance of taking advantage of the catching-up status, building upon the research and development cost advantages and clustering around external initiatives as well as the correction of important constraints to the construction of a RIS." />

The design of the forum was as a moderated fishbowl discussion with invited discussants and the audience. The aim was to discuss the problem situation and possible strategies for policy improvements among researchers and policy practice. The discussants included policy makers and stakeholders from research policy, forestry, forest industry and regional development. The discussion forum was video recorded. This enabled the extraction and review of all major issues raised throughout the discussion, and the transcription of parts of particular importance. The main questions were directed at the success and gaps of current policies and which policy improvements are needed in order to support innovations in the sector and for rural development. These questions were discussed for territorial goods and services, and for the wood value chains. Results suggest a need for improving the interface between research and practice. Support for innovation should move away from project-based support to long-term cooperation and collaborative learning, and from a focus on research to the support of the whole innovation process and better interaction of all parts of the innovation system. Policy measures need to define characteristics and address different types of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) such as innovative front-runners and/or traditional firms. For the forest sector, it is also relevant that rural development policy considers all sectors that interact in the landscape, is multi-layered and stimulates connectivity and integration at and between the appropriate levels." />

In this transition pattern, novelties are initially adopted as 'modular innovation' into existing systems and subsequently reconfigure the basic architecture through new combinations of old and new elements. Incumbent actors survive these transitions through interactions with suppliers of knowledge and innovations. Using Pavitt's innovation typology, we selected a case study from his supplier-dominated category: greenhouse farming. The article makes a techno-economic analysis of the overall transition pattern in Dutch greenhouse horticulture (1930-1980) and a socio-institutional analysis of the knowledge flows and networks.

    <att name="AB" value="Background: Uganda has a long history of health research, but still faces critical health problems. It has made a number of recent moves towards building science and technology capacity which could have an impact on local health, if innovation can be fostered and harnessed. Methods: Qualitative case study research methodology was used. Data were collected through reviews of academic literature and policy documents and through open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 30 people from across the science-based health innovation system, including government officials, researchers in research institutes and universities, entrepreneurs, international donors, and non-governmental organization representatives. Results: Uganda has a range of institutions influencing science-based health innovation, with varying degrees of success. However, the country still lacks a coherent mechanism for effectively coordinating STI policy among all the stakeholders. Classified as a least developed country, Uganda has opted for exemptions from the TRIPS intellectual property protection regime that include permitting parallel importation and providing for compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals. Uganda is unique in Africa in taking part in the Millennium Science Initiative (MSI), an ambitious though early-stage $30m project, funded jointly by the World Bank and Government of Uganda, to build science capacity and encourage entrepreneurship through funding industry-research collaboration. Two universities - Makerere and Mbarara - stand out in terms of health research, though as yet technology development and commercialization is weak. Uganda has several incubators which are producing low-tech products, and is beginning to move into higher-tech ones like diagnostics. Its pharmaceutical industry has started to create partnerships which encourage innovation. Conclusions: Science-based health product innovation is in its early stages in Uganda, as are policies for guiding its development. Nevertheless, there is political will for the development of STI in Uganda, demonstrated through personal initiatives of the President and the government's willingness to invest heavily for the long term in support of STI through the Millennium Science Initiative. Activities to support technology transfer and private-public collaboration have been put in motion; these need to be monitored, coordinated, and learned from. In the private sector, there are examples of incremental innovation to address neglected diseases driven by entrepreneurial individuals and South-South collaboration. Lessons can be learned from their experience that will help support Ugandan health innovation." />

    <att name="AB" value="Background: Tanzania is East Africa's largest country. Although it is socially diverse, it has experienced general political stability since independence in 1964. Despite gradual economic development and Tanzania's status as one of the biggest recipients of aid in Africa, health status remains poor. This paper explores Tanzania's science-based health innovation system, and highlights areas which can be strengthened. Methods: Qualitative case study research methodology was used. Data were collected through reviews of academic literature and policy documents, and through open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 52 people from across the science-based health innovation system over two visits to Tanzania from July to October 2007. Results and discussion: Tanzania has a rich but complex S&amp;T governance landscape, with the public sector driving the innovation agenda through a series of different bodies which are not well-coordinated. It has some of the leading health research on the continent at the University of Dar es Salaam, Muhimbili University of Health and Applied Sciences, the National Institute for Medical Research and the Ifakara Medical Institute, with strong donor support. Tanzania has found developing an entrepreneurial culture difficult; nevertheless projects such as the clusters initiative at the University of Dar es Salaam are encouraging low-tech innovation and overcoming knowledge-sharing barriers. In the private sector, one generics company has developed a South-South collaboration to enable technology transfer and hence the local production of anti-retrovirals. Local textile company A to Z Textiles is now manufacturing 30 million insecticide impregnated bednets a year. Conclusions: To have a coherent vision for innovation, Tanzania may wish to address some key issues: coordination across stakeholders involved with health research, increasing graduates in health-related disciplines, and building capabilities in biological testing, preclinical testing, formulation and standardization, and related areas important to moving from basic research to applications. The private sector can be encouraged to innovate through improved access to financing, and incentives for R&amp;D. The diaspora community represents an untapped source for partnerships and access to other developing world markets and technology. The government may wish to set up mechanisms to encourage south-south collaborations, and to bring the public and private sector together around specific projects to help realize the country's innovation potential." />

We use an innovation systems framework, which takes into account the wide variety of stakeholders and knowledge flows contributing to the innovation process. The study takes into account the destruction of the country's scientific infrastructure and human capital that occurred during the 1994 genocide, and describes government policy, research institutes and universities, the private sector, and NGOs that are involved in health product innovation in Rwanda. Methods: Case study research methodology was used. Data were collected through reviews of academic literature and policy documents and through open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 38 people from across the science-based health innovation system. Data was collected over two visits to Rwanda between November - December 2007 and in May 2008. A workshop was held in Kigali on May 23rd and May 24th 2009 to validate the findings. A business plan was then developed to operationalize the findings. Results and discussion: The results of the study show that Rwanda has strong government will to support health innovation both through its political leadership and through government policy documents. However, it has a very weak scientific base as most of its scientific infrastructure as well as human capital were destroyed during the 1994 genocide. The regulatory agency is weak and its nascent private sector is ill-equipped to drive health innovation. In addition, there are no linkages between the various actors in the country's health innovation system i.e between research institutions, universities, the private sector, and government bureaucrats. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the 1994 genocide destroyed most of the scientific infrastructure and human capital, the country has made remarkable progress towards developing its health innovation system, mainly due to political goodwill. The areas of greatest potential for Rwanda are in traditional plant technologies. However, there is need for investments in domestic skill development as well as infrastructure that will enhance innovation. Of foremost importance is the establishment of a platform to link the various actors in the health innovation system." />

This paper assesses the effectiveness of the South Korean technopark. Technoparks on average had a higher number of tenants, tenant employees, and tenant firm sales compared to those of the other business incubators in Korea. Although the survival rate was relatively high in technoparks compared to that of the other business incubators, some of the technoparks were not effective at encouraging tenants to graduate from the incubator in a timely manner. The support program provided by the technopark format enables firms to easily access innovation resources and to reduce the costs of doing business. The incubator reduces the operating costs of tenant firms by providing facilities and shared services at low cost as well as aiding in market expansion. Moreover, the incubator provides tenant firms with research and development support, which results in the enhancement of innovation capability. Nonetheless, the strategies of the technopark and local government have not been sufficiently thorough in encouraging the incubated firms to settle in the same jurisdiction, in order to promote regional economic growth and to stimulate a continuous regional innovation system. We explored the organizational performance of the technopark and ascertained the relationship between the organizational effectiveness and the performance outcome. Local government and the technopark should coown the objectives and connect their support systems, to lead the firms incubated in a technopark to settle and grow successfully in the local region. This examination of working technoparks in South Korea will contribute to the development of strategies for creating science parks in other developing countries." />

Empirical findings reveal that researchers' individual characteristics, such as centrality in the academic system, age and sex, matter more than publishing records or formal degrees. Institutional specificities at country level also play a role in shaping the propensity of researchers to engage with industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." />

This approach posits that new technology is developed, demonstrated and deployed in the context of a technological innovation system. The performance assessment of the CCS innovation system shows that the extensive knowledge base and knowledge networks, which have been accumulated over the past years. have not yet been utilized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. This indicates that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS In order to move the CCS innovation system through this present difficult episode and deploy more advanced CCS concepts at a larger scale, it is necessary to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions, i e entrepreneurial activity, market creation and the mobilization of resources Moreover, in some specific countries it is needed to provide more regulatory guidance and improve the legitimacy for the technology. We discuss how policy makers and technology managers can use these insights to develop a coherent policy strategy that would accelerate the deployment of CCS (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    <att name="AB" value="The relationship between knowledge investments, innovation and competitiveness is an important topic in both academic research and economic policy and has been studied extensively over the past decades. Nowadays, investments in private and public R&amp;D are believed to make up the heart of a modem knowledge economy. The present paper adopts an evolutionary economics perspective and investigates whether, in addition to private R&amp;D activities, also institutional support systems and policy interventions play a role in inducing innovation initiatives and creating impacts on the performance and competitiveness of industries. We aim to find support for the hypothesis that the competitiveness of industries in the international arena is sustained by the dynamic interaction between national, regional and sectoral innovation systems. This may provide stakeholders with a better understanding of the context in which they operate. Since according to the evolutionary metaphor, the growth of an innovation system follows complex dynamics that cannot simply be analysed within a static quantitative equilibrium framework, we use here an alternative approach based on qualitative pattern recognition analysis originating from artificial intelligence analysis. Besides R&amp;D expenditures, human capital expenditures are regarded as the major input in the knowledge creation process in our analytical framework To this end, in our paper a qualitative causal model that maps out conditional relations between key factors in national innovation systems will be described. The focus of our investigation is on systematic patterns in the competitiveness of the EU Member States, using statistical information on innovation input and output data from the European Innovation Scoreboard. In our analysis we find support for the hypothesis that there are indeed significant interactions between distinct institutional levels, which may provide guidance to the strategic orientation of nations and the European Union in terms of the emphasis on competitiveness vis-A-vis cohesion.

To move from activities that enhance the current fossil fuel-based lock-ins and create an environment that increases the chance of successful transfer and diffusion of RETs, the Sunshine Power Cities project was established in southern Taiwan in 2005. This project was initiated by the Bureau of and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Here, a detailed evaluation of the project is carried out by Energy retrospectively analyzing whether or not it strengthened local renewable energy innovations to develop Sunshine Cities as part of the strategy to help their cities gain RET status and in the process construct shared national and city identities.

Because of the imperfections in technology markets, an active approach towards technology licensing does not automatically result in licensing transactions. To balance prior research, which has focused on licensing transactions as the outcome of licensing intentions, we take a contingency view to analyze how characteristics of a firm's innovation ecosystem determine different strategic types of licensing. Specifically, we distinguish proactive licensing, which refers to identifying recipients for technology transactions, and reactive licensing, which relates to offering licenses to infringers of a firm's intellectual property. Survey data show that environmental antecedents concerning appropriability, i.e., patent protection and technological turbulence, and determinants regarding technology markets, i.e., transaction frequency and competitive intensity, have different effects on proactive and reactive licensing. On this basis, the article has major implications for research into technology licensing, markets for technology, and open innovation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved." />

It is assumed that for an emerging technology to fruitfully develop, it should be fostered by a Technological Innovation System (TIS), which is the network of actors, institutions and technologies in which it is embedded. For an emerging technology a TIS has yet to be built up. This research focuses on the dynamics of this build-up process by mapping the development of seven key activities: so-called system functions. The main contribution revolves around the notion of cumulative causation, or the phenomenon that the build-up of a TIS accelerates due to system functions reinforcing each other over time. As an empirical basis, an analysis is provided of the historical development of the TIS around automotive natural gas technology in the Netherlands (1970-2007). The results show that this TIS undergoes a gradual build-up in the 1970s, followed by a breakdown in the 1980s and, again, a build-up from 2000 to 2007. It is shown that underlying these trends are different forms of cumulative causation, here called motors of innovation.

Based on the TIS functions approach, we condense supportive and obstructive factors and discuss the differences in the respective national setting for small-scale renewable and combined heat and power (CHP) technologies. The findings underline the relevance of legitimation and of institutional and financial support. High degrees of legitimacy were achieved in both the UK and Germany. In Germany, early institutional and financial support reduced uncertainty for new market entrants and consumers, and fuelled a self-reinforcing diffusion dynamic for small renewables. In the UK, by comparison, microgeneration enjoys little support. The paper concludes that distributed generation will not be successful without a more focussed and technology-oriented innovation policy." />

    <att name="AB" value="Gasified biomass is a technology that has the potential to partially replace fossil fuels for the production of heat, electricity, transport fuels, synthetic natural gas (BioSNG) and chemicals. In the context of climate change, biomass gasification is an attractive technology. It is, however, still in the early phase of its diffusion and much of the knowledge resides in the academic sector and in small companies-the technological innovation system (TIS) is in the process of being formed. Austria is one of the leading European countries in this field and much of the development in Austria can be traced to one prominent individual, Professor Hermann Hofbauer at the Technical University of Vienna. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how and the extent to which an individual academic, Professor Hofbauer, has influenced the formation of a TIS centred on gasified biomass in Austria. We find that his impact is multidimensional and significant but that there is also a frictional and intentional resistance that obstructs the commercialisation of the new technology. These sources of resistance go beyond the ability of an individual system builder to handle. Policy makers, therefore, need to add a strong element of system building activities that interact with and supplement those pursued by Professor Hofbauer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the structure (in terms of density, centralisation, clustering, assortativity, centre-periphery and resilience) of these international knowledge flows through network analysis techniques and we test the influence of geographical distance as opposed to sectoral (based on the industrial distribution of innovative activity) and functional (based on the value of the European technological index) distances in shaping the strength of knowledge relations through a gravitational model. Network Analysis techniques applied to the configuration of international knowledge flows between European regions highlight the existence of a polarised hierarchical structure. By estimating a &quot;gravity equation&quot; model we demonstrate that, far from the claim of the &quot;death of distance&quot;, geographic distance is still relevant for determining the structure of inter-regional knowledge flows. Functional and, above all, sectoral distances play also a relevant role suggesting that knowledge flows easier between similar regions (according to their technological level and the industrial distribution of their innovation system)." />

    <att name="AB" value="The support of sustainable energy innovations has become a dominant topic on the political agenda of many countries. Providing this support remains difficult, since the processes constituting such innovation trajectories are poorly understood. To increase insight in such processes, this paper takes the historical development of biofuels in the Netherlands as the topic of study. Special attention is paid to the simultaneous development of two technology generations within the field: a first generation (1G) and a second generation (2G) of biofuels. A critical question asked is whether deployment programmes for a I G technology may have positive effects on the development of later generations. Two archetypical support strategies are identified: one is to keep investing in R&amp;D concerning 2G technology, where the expected outcome is a fast move from one technology generation to the other. The other strategy is to focus on learning-by-doing in the 1G technology. In that way progress can be made in 1G technologies but the effects on 2G technologies are uncertain. We apply a Technological Innovation System perspective to analyse the strategies followed and their effects. From the results we draw lessons of relevance for practitioners who aspire to understand and influence emerging energy technologies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved." />

    <att name="AB" value="Governments have invested heavily in the clinical and economic promise of health innovation and express increasing concern with the efficacy and efficiency of the health innovation system. in considering strategies for 'better' health innovation, policy makers and researchers have taken a particular interest in the work of universities and related public research organizations: How do these organizations identify and transfer promising innovations to market, and do these efforts make best use of public sector investments? We conducted an ethnographic study of technology transfer offices (TTOs) in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada, to consider the place of health and health system imperatives in judgments of value in early-stage health innovation. Our analysis suggests that the valuation process is poorly specified as a set of task-specific judgments. Instead, we argue that technology transfer professionals are active participants in the construction of the innovation and assign value by 'imagining' the end product in its 'context of use'. Oriented as they are to the commercialization of health technology, TTOs understand users primarily as market players. The immediate users of TTOs' efforts are commercial partners (i.e., licensees, investors) who are capable of translating current discoveries into future commodities. The ultimate end users - patients, clinicians, health systems - are the future consumers of the products to be sold. Attention to these proximate and more distal users in the valuation process is a complex and constitutive feature of the work of health technology transfer. At the same time, judgements about individual technologies are made in relation to a broader imperative through which TTOs seek to imagine and construct sustainable innovation systems. judgments of value are rendered sensible in relation to the logic of valuation for systems of innovation that, in turn, configure users of health innovation in systemic ways.

Our objective is to show that the transformations that have occurred in the past 10 years have not only redefined skills and the organization of production, but also have given a more strategic place to knowledge management (KM) practices. We provide a contextual and historical overview based on qualitative interviews, in order to better understand the relation between KM and innovative behaviour in this industry. We build an original industrial and technological database comprising various samples that provides quantitative information concerning KM and innovative practices. The results of the statistical analysis reveal the specificity of firms in this industry. Taking account of the size of these firms and their technological intensity, we show that the behaviour of defence industry firms in terms of KM practices, differs from that of other firms. This is evident from their technological performance, and innovation and patenting intensity. This structural tendency is explained as an innovative behaviour in the French national innovation system rather than merely a 'trend'. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While the developed ERIS type of regional innovation systems due to its marked orientation towards individual actors and their behaviour leans more towards the main stream of entrepreneurship research, the IRIS type of regional innovation systems has more similarities with conventional innovation system research. It is argued that by also applying concepts depicting different management preferences and behaviour from entrepreneurship research, we should be able to better understand the different logics guiding these two types of regional innovation systems.

In this study we evaluate and compare national approaches towards the development of CCS in the U. S. A, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. The analysis is done by using the functions of innovation systems approach. This approach implicates that new technology is developed, demonstrated and deployed in the context of a technological innovation system. By the assessment made in this study the strengths and weaknesses of the innovation systems are identified, which is vital for the development of a coherent (long-term) policy strategy that enhance the successful implementation of CCS. The performance assessment and comparison of the CCS innovation systems shows that the extensive knowledge base and knowledge networks, which have been accumulated over the past years, has not yet been valorized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. This indicates that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and the USA. In order to move the CCS innovation systems through this present difficult episode and deploy more advanced CCS concepts at a larger scale; it is necessary to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions, i.e. entrepreneurial activity, market formation and the mobilization of resources. Moreover, in some specific countries governmental guidance and the creation of legitimacy also needs more attention. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved" />

For years, it has been said that innovation is achieved by breaking through the boundaries of existing technologies. This paper has argued how nanotechnology is driven by scientific research and in what way traditional disciplines are fused into this emerging area. We attempt to provide an empirical analysis of the dynamics of nanoscience fusion trajectories, which is typically a focused area in innovation studies. In this paper, we seek to understand the attributes that are likely to enable scientific disciplines to fuse into nanoscience through a combination of quantitative and qualitative search within nanotechnology systems of innovation (NanoSI). An insight of the similarity and disparity of fusion between Europe and Japan is also provided. Finally, we develop an integrative framework to explore the co-evolutionary nature of nanotech.

As a small open economy, Austria faces special challenges with regard to this on-going process. The share of Austrian R&amp;D financed from abroad is outstanding in international comparison. Indeed, a significant portion of R&amp;D activities in Austria is defined by strategic decisions of international corporations, which are re-assessing their spatial division of labour continuously. In our paper, we analyse the characteristics of these foreign-owned corporations in Austria and demonstrate that they form the more 'modern' part of Austrian industry. At the same time, we show that these companies and R&amp;D facilities are embedded in the Austrian national innovation system (NIS) to a large extent. This embeddedness is also explicitly and implicitly supported by the Austrian technology policy.

    <att name="AB" value="Stem cell science is an emerging global industry in which nation states compete fiercely for economic advantage. Currently, the USA dominates this international competition but critics have argued that it lacks an innovation strategy to maintain its position. Strong international competition and internal policy problems may pose significant challenges to the future of US stem cell science. At the same time, the governments of the UK, China, India, Australia and Singapore are developing strategies to enhance their competitive edge within the global stem cell economy. How should the US government respond to these developments? Is a federal strategy necessary to protect the advantages of the US stem cell industries or can it be assumed that the present innovation infrastructure is sufficiently flexible and dynamic to cope with the global challenge? In this paper we address these questions through an examination of the US stem cell innovation system from the perspectives of science, society and the market." />

    <att name="AB" value="University knowledge transfer, which contains both codified and non-codified knowledge, is an important source of industry innovativeness. The geographic constraint on university knowledge flows, which is commonly observed in Western countries, makes proximity with universities a big plus in creating learning regions. No systematic study has been conducted in China regarding such geographic constraint on knowledge transfer and its implications on China's nation and regional innovation systems. Taking advantage of the Chinese patent data, this paper examines the geographic variations in university-industry collaborations in China from 1985 to 2004 and shows a decentralizing/localizing trend in knowledge flows from university to industry. The blockmodel analysis further reveals the roles of different provinces and municipalities in the National Innovation System and how those had changed over time. Besides showing a vivid picture of the knowledge exchange patterns among Chinese provinces and municipalities, the results suggest that the geographic constraint on knowledge flows only becomes salient in China in recent years due to the administrative decentralization and the economic reform. As a result of these changes, less favored regions are further left behind not only due to their shortage of local university resources, but also because of the reduced extra-local knowledge support, which constitutes an important supplemental resource for regional development.

    <att name="PY" value="2008" />
    <att name="Z9" value="15" />
    <att name="AB" value="This paper deals with the question of why making a catch-up is even more difficult in capital goods industries that are usually led by small or middle-sized companies. It relies upon the sectoral systems of innovation as a theoretical framework for analysis. From the findings, the paper has identified three sources of difficulties in the catch-up of the capital goods industry, particularly in machine tools. First, while small firms in the capital goods industry are usually specialized suppliers to big final goods assembly firms in the consumer goods industry or other industries, and thus the tacit knowledge accumulated from the interface between the producer and the customer firms is very important, a serious difficulty lies in the fact that local client firms are reluctant to use locally made capital goods due to their poor quality and low precision level. Second, while a successful catch-up first requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries, a typical difficulty arises because incumbent foreign firms often react by charging predatory prices upon news of the local development of capital goods by latecomers. Third, if the catch-up firms overcome this barrier, then the next strategy used by incumbent firms is to charge latecomers with legal actions for patent violations. Despite these intrinsic difficulties, the Korean economy has achieved a very slow but gradual catch-up in the capital goods industry. The paper has attributed such achievement to several factors, including the strenuous efforts of the government, niche markets in general-purpose machine tools and emerging economies, and finally, the increasing introduction and adoption of information technology (IT) or digital technologies in machine tools. Furthermore, the three sources of barriers to catch-up imply that any latecomer firms that wish to record a successful catch-up should have these barriers in mind from the beginning of the road towards catch-up. We observe that a successful catch-up requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries. After the initial success, they should also be well prepared against eventual or possible attacks by the incumbent firms in the forms of predatory pricing and intellectual property rights (IPR) charges." />

    <att name="AB" value="Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how research on knowledge-based economy (KBE) has increased noticeably in recent years. However, while some literature is available on construct model and validity analysis, little information is available on causal model. Design/methodology/approach - This work used the Knowledge Assessment Scorecards of World Bank, applying the linear structural relation model to address the causal model of knowledge-based economy. Findings - The results found that an open innovation system was the key to the knowledge-based economy competitiveness, and the effective information technology and excellent human resources were over the economic environment. Research limitations/implications - This work is a cross sectional analysis that considers the causality between different KBE endowments. However, focusing on specific group by longitudinal analysis should be further considered. Moreover, this work addresses the causality between different KBE endowments; however, the proposed model did not compare the differences between the different countries, regions, and socioeconomics. Practical implications - This work suggests that every country should construct an open national innovations system, and that not only focuses on the participated public and private sectors but also expands to relative economic structure, regime, and various social cooperation networks that help effectively improve collective learning and knowledge innovation. Originality/value - This work used the 2005 KAS comprising a set of 80 structural and qualitative variables that benchmark how an economy compares with its neighbors, competitors, or countries. The comparison is undertaken for a group of 132 countries that include almost all of OECD economies and about 90 developing countries. Moreover, this work used the path analysis with observed variables (PA-OV) model under the LISREL to address the causality between different KBE endowments. Overall, this work proposed some important conclusions and suggestions." />

However, it is not certain that these economically viable RETs will indeed be implemented and utilized, since this is greatly influenced by various social, institutional and political factors (i.e., the Innovation System). In order to steer away from activities that enhance the current fossil fuel based lock-in situation and create an environment that increases the chance of a successful transfer and diffusion of RETs, several projects have been set up in the Maldives. These projects have been initiated by the Global Environmental Facility, the United Nations Development Program, and the European Commission. In this article we evaluate these projects by analyzing whether or not they strengthen the local Renewable Energy Innovation System. This evaluation shows that these RE programs strengthen most of the key processes necessary in an Innovation System conducive to technology transfer. However, as not enough attention is being paid to local entrepreneurial activities and the creation of a domestic market for RETs, the process of RET transfer might run the risk of stagnation after completion of the RE programs.

However, this has proven to be a difficult task. To increase insight in such processes, this paper takes biofuel technologies in the mobility sector as the topic of a comparative case study. Various national governments have supported innovation trajectories around biofuels. We analyse, assess and compare two such trajectories as they have developed so far: one in the Netherlands and one in Sweden. A Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach is applied. A TIS is constituted by actors, networks and institutions, that are to be gradually constructed around a technology. We analyse whether governments and entrepreneurs have succeeded in developing seven key processes, or system functions, necessary for the development and diffusion of biofuel technologies. By analysing the build-up of system functions over time we identify virtuous and vicious forms of cumulative causation. The Dutch and Swedish TISs for biofuels are followed from 1990 to 2005. Our comparison shows that, due to a variety in function fulfilment and the emergence of cumulative causation, the Swedish TIS has reached a market expansion and broad social implementation of biofuels, whereas the Dutch TIS has established considerably less." />

The authors present also the varying involvement of academia, public research institutions and commercial companies in relevant research by finding main research contributors, discourse development, as well as clusters or knowledge networks of affiliations and countries. The research findings show that the significant output of commercial companies in Japan and the United States is different from the situation in the European Union, where the relevant scientific activities are dominated by academic and government research institutions.

Focusing on the commercialization community around the university, it is looked at how this community of geographically proximate but initially organizationally and cognately remote actors built a common understanding to solve the problems involved in exploiting intellectual property in the impoverished regional innovation system (RIS) of the north-east of England." />

    <att name="AB" value="A new approach in science policy making named the innovation system (IS) approach has been developed during the past three decades. Its primary goal is to better understand the processes through which scientific knowledge is produced and transferred to businesses to improve their competitiveness and develop national and/or regional economies. This approach has been adopted as an analytical framework and guideline for science policy making by numerous public sector organizations around the world. Using a case study of the Canadian and Quebec public sectors, our research seeks to understand why the IS approach has gained the adherence of government employees and how it has been disseminated from international organizations down to regional civil servants. Findings show that adherence to the IS approach stems from the prestige of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its associated epistemic community, and from the cultural authority science exerts on government employees; these two factors bestow cultural authority onto the IS approach. The perceived scientific validity of the IS approach also leads government employees to consider its underlying economistic worldview as an unquestionable reality." />

It is argued that the necessary knowledge is fragmented in literature among studies on new product development, knowledge management and organizational learning, organizational competences and technological innovation. It presents two concepts: (a) the concept of Intermediate Technological Leadership (ITL), as an enterprise purpose to be reached and (b) the concept of Intra-organizational Innovation System (IIS), as a model to be constructed and applied in local subsidiaries in order to enable the achievement of all necessary technological competences. The integration of theoretical sources reveals six fundamental elements for an IIS: strategic adequacy, interpretation of external environment, conception of internal organizational structure, integration of external structure, systematization of organizational basic processes, and consideration of human factors and relationships. It is expected that the theoretical basis presented in this study will serve as a reference to be validated in real-world applications." />

    <att name="AB" value="This paper focuses on the roles and functions of the Norwegian venture capital industry in the innovation system. A lack of competent capital is often mentioned as a serious obstacle for financing innovation, and in particular for financing knowledge-intensive enterprises at their start-up and early development stages. In these stages the supply of strategic activities is just as important as capital, and venture capitalists are assumed to provide their enterprises with both capital and knowledge. Venture capital investments are also geographically clustered in cities and urban areas, and cities are said to have specific innovation advantages which reduce transaction costs associated with venture capital investing. Particularly larger cities have both a diverse knowledge-base and the geographical proximity which seem to be a prerequisite for sharing and transfer of the often complex and non-codified knowledge that are related to financing new knowledge-intensive enterprises. A better understanding of the role venture capitalists play in the innovation system may not only enhance our knowledge of innovation processes and strengthen the basis for innovation policies, but may also contribute to a better understanding of the industrial dynamics and the spatial development of a knowledge economy. The data employed in the paper comes from in-depth interviews with venture capital firms and seed funds in Norway, and from a survey of portfolio enterprises. All data are collected in 2002 and 2003." />

    <att name="AB" value="Economy- and technology-driven theories dominate current explanations of social change. The political orientations of the European Union and many of its member states are increasingly based on the idea of knowledge economy where public organisations move towards market-orientation. Among the other producers of knowledge, universities are expected to become part of the innovation system where innovation stands for product making and the final goal is to contribute to the international competitiveness of the national economy. This study focuses on the complicated role of public universities as adaptors of market forces logic. The focus of attention is on the reorientations that Finnish universities have made in terms of commodification. At the same time universities have elaborated new aggressive strategies in order to strengthen their scientific basis and to distance themselves from the demands for new managerialism. One of the key problems in this process is related to the difficulties to integrate the two traditional university functions into the third one, i.e. commercialisation. We make some observations concerning EU policies, but concentrate mostly on changes that have taken place during recent decades in Finland by analysing market-orientation in three Helsinki area universities. In the context of current technology policy, all disciplines have been seen as potential contributors to market competition. However, social sciences produce knowledge that cannot be classified by using pure economic concepts. To sharpen our analysis of market-orientation we study three social science departments at the respective three universities. This analysis indicates the importance of scientific identity as a component of market-orientation. It also shows the importance of contextual issues and the tensions that arise between scientific and commercial orientations." />

These ways of actions are manifold, but at least policy attentions to three key mechanisms are critical. These mechanisms encourage partnership in the commercialization process, foster entrepreneurship and venture initiatives in the innovation system, and sustain commercialization and the creation of new firms.

By estimating a knowledge production function we find that building external interactions is of greater importance than developing internal innovative competences. Second, unintended knowledge flows have less influence on regional innovative performance than deliberate ones. Lastly, the French innovation system looks regional rather than sectoral.

Furthermore, the role of government agencies and interest groups that provide financial support as well as commercial and technical information should also be taken into account. However, the review of relevant theoretical and empirical investigations related to the German experience shows that such innovation and R&amp;D cooperation networks appear to be less significant than expected. In general various regional technology policy measures adopted in German states ( the provision of research infrastructure, establishment of technology centres, innovative small and medium sized enterprises support programmes, etc.) have been more successful in economically better-off large cities than in the rural areas.

In Scotland a bold 'knowledge economy' strategy is evolving around endogenous growth; while in Wales, the Welsh Development Agency and other 'quangos' are to be absorbed into the Assembly government as elements of an endogenous innovation system policy falter.

The paper highlights the business incubation system as an aspect of the triple helix model of innovation in which universities, industry, government and non-government organizations feature as principal actors in the national innovation system. The paper notes the need for both technology transfer and the development of the triple helix culture in developing countries. It also underlines the need for policy in developing countries to ensure that the former played only a residual role, while the latter took the lead in providing for the development of a culture of innovation. The culture of bureaucracy and institutional fragmentation has been a major factor militating against initiatives for technological capability development; and the conventional technology transfer practice has reinforced this culture. A major policy initiative is needed in developing countries to put the national system of innovation in place and remove the constraints on the development of the triple helix culture." />

The most notable of these is the emergence of a few 'Bioscience Megacentres' for basic and applied bioscience medical and clinical research (molecular, post-genomic, proteomics, etc.), biotechnology research, training in these and related fields, academic entrepreneurship and commercial exploitation by clusters of 'drug discovery' start-up and spin-off companies, along with specialist venture capital and other innovation system support services. Large pharmaceutical firms that used to lead such knowledge generation and exploitation processes are becoming increasingly dependent upon innovative drug solutions produced in such clusters, and megacentres are now the predominant source of such commercial knowledge. 'Big pharma' is seldom at the heart of megacentres such as those the paper will argue are found in about four locations each in the USA and Europe, but remains important for some risk capital ('milestone payments), marketing, and distribution of drugs discovered. The embedding of these processes also creates major new regional disparities, which some regional governances have recognised, causing them to develop responsibilities for regional science policy and funding to offset spatial biases intrinsic in traditional national (and in the EU, supranational) research funding regimes. Responses follow a variety of models ranging from market:following to both regionalised (decentralising by the centre) and 'regionalist' (ground-up); in each case, the role of megacentres is justified in health terms.

Not only does it describe the role and performance of particular institutions, but this framework also explores four major interactions among these institutions for illustrating the dynamics and efficiency of innovation systems, that is, R&amp;D collaboration, informal interaction, technology diffusion, and personnel mobility. The framework is applied to compare the innovation systems of Taiwan and China, revealing that they both have unique characteristics, while also sharing numerous complementary features. In addition, the two economies have the linguistic, cultural, racial and historical similarities, plus their geographical proximity. Consequently, these phenomena suggest the possibility of future cooperation between the two innovation systems, and then this paper proposes possible approaches to achieving cooperation for the two sides.

Since the mid-1990s, and especially after the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, Hong Kong's innovation system has been more interactive and horizontal, which has some family resemblance to the 'Triple Helix' government-industry-university system, which is a stylised version of NIS.

It can be argued that we are now seeing the strong rebirth of regionalism (at least at the State level) as far as government support for science, technology and knowledge-based industries is concerned. The paper traces the growth of regional innovation policies through examples of initiatives from South Australia and other regions and examines the respective contributions of the State and federal governments. The character of State government support has evolved over the last 15 years, from sponsoring grand 'technology citadels' to today's strategies that take a more bottom-up approach to building intense innovation environments, local clusters and knowledge hubs. Some of these trends reflect the influence of the global knowledge economy on regional industries, while others (notably the relative decline of the federal government as an R&amp;D performer) are peculiarities of the Australian innovation system. The outcome is a significant evolution in Australia's innovation system, one which parallels responses to globalisation in other countries and suggests a different - but not diminished role for public sector innovation policy." />

    <att name="AB" value="In spite of the diffusion of science parks in Europe, it is still unclear whether they have been successful in fostering the establishment and growth of new technology-based firms (NTBFs). This paper aims to contribute to answer such question. For this purpose, a sample composed of 45 Italian NTBFs which at the beginning of 2000 were located on technology incubator within a park is compared with a control sample of off-incubator firms. Aspects considered in the study include the personal characteristics of founders of NTBFs, the motivations of the self-employment choice, the growth and innovative performances of firms, propensity towards networking, and access to public subsidies. In the comparison, we use a larger set of indicators than in previous studies. The empirical results confirm the conventional wisdom that input and output measures of innovative activity are only marginally different between on- and off-incubator firms. Nonetheless, they also show that Italian parks managed to attract entrepreneurs with better human capital, as measured by educational attainments and prior working experience. In addition, on-incubator firms show higher growth rates than their off-incubator counterparts. They also perform better in terms of adoption of advanced technologies, aptitude to participating in international R&amp;D programs, and establishment of collaborative arrangements, especially with universities. Lastly, they find it easier to get access to public subsidies. Altogether, such findings support the view that science parks are an important element of a technology policy in favor of NTBFs. This holds true especially in a country like Italy which is characterized by a rather weak national innovation system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved." />

On the one hand, it seeks to challenge the stereotyped image of the French system, presented in the literature as completely characterised by the dominant role of a Colbertist state (that is to say an interventionist model which places emphasis on the dominant weight of large civil and defence programmes, on the division between the universities and the CNRS, on the congenital separation between research and firms, on the monopolisation of public support by certain large industrial groups). Evolutionary changes are described, which prove that this classic image is no longer relevant in capturing the current dynamic of the French research and innovation system. On the other hand, this paper seeks to show that this challenge is a consequence of close examination of the relevance of the notion of &quot;national policy for research and technology&quot; itself. Alongside national policy, regional and European policies are emerging, the effects of which are so important that public intervention can no longer be seen only in terms of national policy.

We review the more quantitative literature on efforts made to study such linkage phenomena, to which theorizing in the science policy area has attributed great importance. We then introduce a typology of three approaches to study the science/technology linkage - patent citation, industrial science, and university patenting. For each approach, we shall discuss merits and possible disadvantages. In another step we illustrate them using results from studies of the Finnish innovation system.

According to the empirical findings of a European TSER project (SMEPOL) this was not fully confirmed: SMEs are less often engaged in innovation networks than larger firms and if they have innovation partnerships they are primarily concentrated on business partners. Because relations to science and technology transfer are rare, SMEs make only limited use of the full potential of their respective regional innovation systems." />

In particular, it focuses on the differences in the S and T systems between South and North Korea. There are some similarities between both systems. There is a strong tendency toward regional concentration of research capacities in a few regions. The public research sector is not functionally divided but some public research institutes carry out comprehensive R and D activities in respective areas. University research is poor in both countries. However, there are strong differences between the two systems. First, South Korean S and T policy has always been to enhance national competitiveness, while North Korean is to support the realization of the socialist revolution. Second, there are several ministries in South Korea that engage in R and D promotion, but there is no ministry-level organization for S and T policy in North Korea and the Labor Party's Office of Science and Technology is very influential in S and T policy. Third, there are about 25 government-sponsored research institutes under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in South Korea, while major R and D activities in North Korea are concentrated in four Academies and a research center. Fourth, South Korean universities have started to play an important role in the national innovation system, but North Korean universities have not shown any satisfactory R and D activities. Finally, South Korean industry is the most important actor in the national innovation system, while North Korean industry has had not much of any role in the national innovation system. This paper argues that these differences should be taken into account in the unification of the South and North Korean innovation systems. It expects that the South Korean system will be the frame of reference for the North Korean system in the unification process. In this sense, the current South Korean system needs to be significantly improved. Unification should be utilized as a valuable opportunity for formulating a competent, unified innovation system for Korea. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved." />

Furthermore, foreign ventures do not seem to be an important player in China's innovation system, while both state-owned and collective-owned industries contribute significantly to creations of new products in China. Finally, some commonly cited significant factors for innovations in western literature such as research and development (R&amp;D) and agglomeration do not seem to explain the spatial distribution of patents in China.

    <att name="AB" value="Over the past several years, it has been pointed out that public research institutes are less productive than private ones; moreover, they need to clarify their roles in the development of Korea's national system of innovation. With a view to identifying the causes of problems in public R&amp;D activities, this study examines three pairs of government-sponsored research institutes (GSRIs) and private R&amp;D organizations in Korea; it compares their strategic goals, the roles of their top managers, their organizational characteristics, and the attitudes of individual researchers. The results, based on responses from 570 R&amp;D managers and professionals in both sectors, reveal the following: compared with private R&amp;D organizations, GSRIs 1) have relatively less dear strategic goals and R&amp;D objectives; 2) their R&amp;D activities are very broad and not well focused; 3) their top management plays a biased external role in order to gain institutional legitimacy; 4) their organizational structure tends to be more decentralized but less flexible; 5) their R&amp;D work climates exhibit higher autonomy, cohesiveness, work-pressure, and risk-taking propensity, but display lower customer-orientation and less fairness in a reward system; and 6) the researchers are dissatisfied with their jobs and organizational incentive systems, and also less committed to the organization. As an attempt to understand the root causes of the salient features of GSRIs, this study further explores the impacts of external environments over the period of their development, including the government Science and Technology policy, the national project funding and accounting systems, and institutional regulations, on their internal management systems. Findings of distinctive managerial features of GSRIs and their relationships with external environments suggest several managerial and policy implications for designing more effective R&amp;D management systems of GSRIs in Korea." />

Then, based on the historical description and case studies, the typical technology development process, especially the processes of technological acquisition, learning, and secondary innovation in Chinese enterprises, is analyzed, The integration between technology acquisition and in-house design and R&amp;D is emphasized. The authors suggest that &quot;assimilation and self-design upon imported technology&quot; (3-I policy) is the suitable and vital technology development avenue for most Chinese firms. To accomplish such a technological avenue, coordination, which exists between product innovation and process innovation, corporate strategy and technology strategy, and technology evolution and organizational change must be organized well and dynamically, As Chinese firms face more severe competition than ever, more attention should be paid to the development of indigenous capabilities for technological innovation. The firms' innovation system (FIS), which emphasizes the infrastructure support for a firms entrepreneurship, R&amp;D system, and organization, as well as high-talent personnel, should be established or improved. Thus, technology strategy and the technological innovation system are currently the two key issues of management of technology (MOT) in China and will continue to be into the coming century." />

    <att name="AB" value="Partly triggered by the Japanese VLSI program, Taiwan launched eight national technology programs in the early 1980s.  But because of its technologically 'imitative' and 'dependent' position, Taiwan's experience in these programs is rather different from most industrialized countries.  First, government has to play a pivotal role because industry lacks strong technical capability.  Secondly, a 'national champion', institutional adjustments and overall development framework are crucial.  Thirdly, the 'whole innovation process' approach is very instrumental by exposing the systemic weaknesses in the national innovation system and directing new investment.  Fourthly, technological convergence and standardization in advanced countries greatly helps concentrate national efforts.  Fifthly, there are many pitfalls in technology transfer and technical service to industry.  Finally, the national programs challenge administrative systems, major R&amp;D institutes and the grand national plan to upgrade themselves." />
