AB Nanotechnology promises significant improvements of advanced materials and manufacturing techniques, which are critical for the future competitiveness of national industries. This paper is concerned with the sectoral innovation system in nanotechnology in a global perspective with an aim to understand worldwide developments in nanotechnology research from its emerging stage. The research highlights cross-country comparisons, actors and institutions in the innovation system based on quantitative method (bibliometrics and tech mining). The authors present also the varying involvement of academia, public research institutions and commercial companies in relevant research by finding main research contributors, discourse development, as well as clusters or knowledge networks of affiliations and countries. The research findings show that the significant output of commercial companies in Japan and the United States is different from the situation in the European Union, where the relevant scientific activities are dominated by academic and government research institutions. The research reveals the learning patterns of nanotech innovation structure for the science pole. The findings can be particularly useful for forming technology strategies, science and technology policies by revealing strengths and weaknesses of the emerging innovation system in nanotech, existing country-level competencies and differences.

AB In this paper, we apply the functions of innovation systems theory to explain the successful, diffusion of cogeneration technology in The Netherlands. We show that the technological innovation system for cogeneration functioned very well and that this explains for a major part the successful diffusion. We also show that the innovation system was positively influenced by actions of the Dutch government. Government actions were aligned to the needs of the other parties in the innovation system. Finally, we show that part of the successful diffusion can be attributed to changes in the institutional environment that were not intended to stimulate cogeneration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB CSIRO, Australia largest public research agency, has changed appreciably over the past three decades as the social, economic, political and technological environment has changed. In this paper, we address five areas of change, namely the nature of the Organisation research, its research funding allocation, its patterns of collaboration, the way it transfers technology and its role in the national innovation scene. We look at some of the pressures leading to change and at the implications of our analysis for the future. CSIRO is no longer the dominant player in Australian science and innovation as other players, notably in the higher education sector, have grown and, despite its undoubted importance as a reservoir of scientific talent and its major scientific and commercial achievements, much uncertainty about its national role remains.

AB The Australian Business Foundation view of the role of CSIRO in Australia innovation system is predicated on a shift in perception about what constitutes innovation. Innovation is the smart application of knowledge to transform businesses, driven by market and customer demands, not just by the commercialisation of intellectual property from science and research. This reinterpretation, based on the Foundation own research, and its adoption necessitates a shift in Australia innovation policy from the current emphasis on increasing the supply of science and research to one that supports the demand pull' of business engagement with customers and markets. This wider angle on innovation policy maximises the benefits to Australia in terms of productivity and economic development. It also serves to expand, not diminish, CSIRO role as a catalyst for Australian innovation.

AB Europe suffers a handicap in terms of competitiveness that is mostly related to innovation. Structural factors such as weak linkages between science and industry and unfavourable conditions for fast-growing SMEs explain the inadequate levels of knowledge creation. Only innovation policy measures that actively support the emergence of innovative firms and lead markets will be able to transform Europe into a leader in the knowledge economy. Cluster and open-innovation policies can foster innovation, responding better to individual needs, while national reform programmes should foster society-driven innovation, paying greater attention to the regional level. This paper outlines the key assumptions and premises of the European Union's contemporary innovation policy.

AB This paper explores the role of universities and research institutes (URIs) in the development of the Chinese economy through a comparison of the development of the Beijing and Shenzhen technology clusters. The two locations, while embedded in the same national innovation system, have exhibited completely different evolutionary trajectories. In the case of Beijing, the URIs have played an extremely important role in the development of largest high technology cluster in China. In contrast, in Shenzhen, which is now the third most important cluster in China, has in the last twenty years policy makers have consciously worked to establish and attract institutions of higher education. We suggest that the Chinese experience, though not without problems, provides an interesting model for other nations with strong URIs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence in industrialized countries shows that universities can supply the crucial underpinnings of dynamic industrial clusters within metropolitan regions. A key component of China's recent reforms in the national innovation system is the promotion of university-based research and technology transfer. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the interactions between two elite universities in Shanghai (Fudan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University) and the metropolitan economy. In particular, it analyzes major institutional changes within the universities and policy changes at local and national levels that have allowed more business engagement. As the universities gain greater autonomy, they are adopting distinctive approaches to commercializing academic research and managing industrial linkages. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent work in regional development has stressed the role of key economic actors in less favoured regions, particularly in high-technology sectors, in making those regions more attractive to outside investors. Of course, in less favoured regions (LFRs), there are rarely strong high-technology sectors able to reconfigure their local environment and provide the necessary local "buzz" to attract the attention of outside investors. In this paper, this issue is addressed by looking at how universities can play this role and have a broader systemic effect on the regional economic environment, by plugging gaps in the local regional innovation system. In this paper, a case study from Newcastle in the north-east of England is taken to consider recent developments which have begun to rebuild the regional innovation system. Focusing on the commercialization community around the university, it is looked at how this community of geographically proximate but initially organizationally and cognately remote actors built a common understanding to solve the problems involved in exploiting intellectual property in the impoverished regional innovation system (RIS) of the north-east of England.

AB A new approach in science policy making named the innovation system (IS) approach has been developed during the past three decades. Its primary goal is to better understand the processes through which scientific knowledge is produced and transferred to businesses to improve their competitiveness and develop national and/or regional economies. This approach has been adopted as an analytical framework and guideline for science policy making by numerous public sector organizations around the world. Using a case study of the Canadian and Quebec public sectors, our research seeks to understand why the IS approach has gained the adherence of government employees and how it has been disseminated from international organizations down to regional civil servants. Findings show that adherence to the IS approach stems from the prestige of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its associated epistemic community, and from the cultural authority science exerts on government employees; these two factors bestow cultural authority onto the IS approach. The perceived scientific validity of the IS approach also leads government employees to consider its underlying economistic worldview as an unquestionable reality.

AB The present study provides a theoretical basis for the development of product technological competence in global automotive organizations in Brazilian subsidiaries. It is argued that the necessary knowledge is fragmented in literature among studies on new product development, knowledge management and organizational learning, organizational competences and technological innovation.
   It presents two concepts: (a) the concept of Intermediate Technological Leadership (ITL), as an enterprise purpose to be reached and (b) the concept of Intra-organizational Innovation System (IIS), as a model to be constructed and applied in local subsidiaries in order to enable the achievement of all necessary technological competences. The integration of theoretical sources reveals six fundamental elements for an IIS: strategic adequacy, interpretation of external environment, conception of internal organizational structure, integration of external structure, systematization of organizational basic processes, and consideration of human factors and relationships. It is expected that the theoretical basis presented in this study will serve as a reference to be validated in real-world applications.

AB This paper focuses on the roles and functions of the Norwegian venture capital industry in the innovation system. A lack of competent capital is often mentioned as a serious obstacle for financing innovation, and in particular for financing knowledge-intensive enterprises at their start-up and early development stages. In these stages the supply of strategic activities is just as important as capital, and venture capitalists are assumed to provide their enterprises with both capital and knowledge. Venture capital investments are also geographically clustered in cities and urban areas, and cities are said to have specific innovation advantages which reduce transaction costs associated with venture capital investing. Particularly larger cities have both a diverse knowledge-base and the geographical proximity which seem to be a prerequisite for sharing and transfer of the often complex and non-codified knowledge that are related to financing new knowledge-intensive enterprises. A better understanding of the role venture capitalists play in the innovation system may not only enhance our knowledge of innovation processes and strengthen the basis for innovation policies, but may also contribute to a better understanding of the industrial dynamics and the spatial development of a knowledge economy. The data employed in the paper comes from in-depth interviews with venture capital firms and seed funds in Norway, and from a survey of portfolio enterprises. All data are collected in 2002 and 2003.

AB The basic path towards greatly raising regional innovation abilities and competitiveness is through constructing regional innovation systems, raising efficiency to the greatest extent, lowering innovation costs, allowing the necessary funds for innovation receive effective integration and use, allowing various knowledge and information to receive reasonable allocation and use, and allowing various services to receive timely and comprehensive supply; this is also an important part of uniting China's goals with regional development, increasing China's overall innovation ability and competitiveness, and vigorously promoting the construction of China's innovation system. Effective knowledge management can influence the allocation and effective use of resources for regional innovation systems, can raise the ability of the action-doer, and improve relation networks and operational mechanisms. It is necessary to formulate and put to use a practical and feasible knowledge management strategy when constructing a stable and strong innovation system.

AB Developing country and its firms can realize technology catch-up by effective technology transfer from foreign advanced countries and by active technological learning to transform the exogenous technological capabilities into indigenous technology capabilities. This paper will employ qualitative data, namely case studies in China's electronics and automobile industries to enquire technology transfer and learning in the context of Japanese firms' interaction with the innovation systems in these two sectors. The findings of this study show the positive impact of technology transfer from the standpoint of both Japanese and Chinese side. It is suggested that technology transfer can be a proper mode of cooperation between Japan and China, given an open institutional context and strategy.

AB China has been one of the most favorite markets in the world for the last decade. With the economic liberalization reforms starting in 1978, China's government provided for Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in a few of provinces on the coastal area (Yao et al, 1998). SEZs in China have been established and aiming to attract direct foreign investment (FDI) to encourage technology transfer and boost exports and employment. Current SEZs in China are mainly located in the southern areas, such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, Hunchun, and Pudong Development Zone (Shanghai). Accompanied by a significant inflow of FDI, more and more transnational companies (TNCs) are increasing their tendency towards and involving in local R&D activities in China. Subsequently foreign companies, which are now increasingly wholly owned foreign enterprises, have come to play significant roles in China's high-tech industrial development. However, since the changes of policies, regional characteristics of manpower, and fruitful university spin-offs, the business opportunities in China are inclined to transit from the south to north and obviously result in a new climate of innovated competitiveness and regional cooperation in China.
   Huge amounts of innovations are already taking place in manufacturing firms all over China, and these firms have often aggregated in geographical clusters and are found in many industrial sectors. In order to successfully engage with China's rising innovation opportunities, acquainting with the new innovation tendency of regional transition, cooperation, and development should be initiated and cognized. This study investigates the innovation tendency of regional transition from the south to north in China by examining the regional characteristics of manpower, revenue of university spin-offs, provincial R&D expenditures and FDI, and regional government policies in China.

AB In the era of information and knowledge economy, it is highly important for excellent enterprises to cultivate dynamic capabilities that reconfigure division innovation resources quickly. Flexible strategy which built on modular innovation networks is a significant and novel domain to explore the way of sustainable development. Modular innovation network is a complex innovation system consisting of several key ingredients and layers. The four key ingredients consist of modular disintegration of holistic complex innovation systems, decomposable semi-independent modular innovation agents, IT infrastructure and synergy mechanism of modular networks across enterprises' internal and external borders. And the layers involve operation level, dynamic alliance level and industrial organization level. Systemic modular disintegration always leads to modular organizations (Glenn Hoetker, 2006) which are semi-independent innovation agents depending on outer synergetic networks. On the premise of keeping to standards of systemic interfaces, modular innovation agents can carry out independently the design, R&D and manufacturing of decomposable components by organizing flexible working teams. Based on above pattern, modular innovation agents can realize the crucial encapsulation of their core technologies and know-how, and their flexibility through supplying a series of modular products and services for different requirements of upper innovation systems. So the modular innovation network provides an open infrastructure for flexible strategy because it can quickly reconfigure modular units to achieve flexible goals without increasing exorbitant costs.

ID ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB With the trend of globalization, many firms have come to stage where full utilization of own resource is no longer sufficient for industrial firms to keep sustainable competitive advantage in global market. Stimulating new industries from emerging technologies becomes essential for high-tech based economies to grow, increase employment opportunities and sustain competitive advantages. Recent studies show that Total Innovative Management (TIM) has been proposed to utilize knowledge economies advantages, integrate global resources to develop emerging technologies and undergo product innovation and technology breakthrough. In this paper we further extend the framework of TIM approach from firm level to the industrial cluster and regionalization. Under this framework, three stimulating mechanisms have been constructed to facilitate new industries from emerging technologies. These mechanisms encourage partnership in the commercialization process, foster entrepreneurship and venture initiatives in the innovation system and sustain commercialization and creation of new firms. The study of wireless communication industry in Taiwan has further illustrated this TIM framework through these proposed mechanisms to show the transformation of emerging technologies to new industries and regional clustering.

AB The research on innovation has become an important thread from the perspectives of system and its relative system theories. According to knowledge about regional innovation system and self-organization theory, the following viewpoints are put forward: (1)innovation integration is defined as a dynamic innovation process and system with a better comprehensive benefit in the times of knowledge economy, taking into account all perspectives of innovation, emphasizing harmony and match from all kinds of innovations, and all kind of innovations interacting with each other innovations such as culture innovation, knowledge innovation, institution innovation, technology innovation, management innovation and so on. (2)regional innovation integration is to realize the sustainable development of regional society and economy by means of the organic combination and dynamic optimization in regional all kinds of innovation (e.g. Culture innovation, knowledge innovation, market innovation, institution innovation, technology innovation, management innovation). And then the difference of all innovators engaging in innovations in regional innovation integration is expounded Based on analyzing the relationship among all innovators of regional innovation integration, the Self-organization model of regional innovation integration is set up and the matrix operation of the model is processed. The operation outcomes are received as follows: (1)there is no competitive effect, but synergetic effect when self-relation of single innovation in region acts on regional innovation integration. (2) if only self-relation of single innovation sub-system in region but lack of interaction among all innovation sub-systems, even if they themselves have effect, they will competitive and synergetic e not contribute to regional innovation integration. (3) The competition effect among the different innovation subsystems has active effect and passive effect, and the active effect has decisive influence on the final result of the regional innovation integration. (4) regional innovation integration by means of the interaction of innovation sub-systems, competition and cooperation under the situation that makes use of the resources in the innovation system, obtain ideal integrated result in the end, and will cause the birth of higher degree innovation integration, this explains the mechanism and its complex evolvement of self-organization about regional innovation integration well.

AB Chinese "The Eleventh Plan For Five Years" presents the strategy of implementing scientific development outlook completely, innovating development model and building innovation-based country. As a hinge of national scientific and technological innovation system, City has huge innovative resources and developmental vitality, and affects the tendency of the socio-economic prosperity in a areas. The construction of innovation-based city is the localization and concretization of innovation-based country construction, and also the major strategic choice toward the future for Chinese cities. Building innovation-based city is a difficult and complex systemic engineering which involves many fields of work. Effective market mechanisms and the rational role of government are the basic strength to promote city innovation. Innovation-based city needs public service-oriented government, and public service-oriented government can foster innovation-based urban construction. Conversely, the level of innovation-based city construction can test the situation of public service-oriented government construction. It is necessary for government to speed up the construction of public service-oriented government, foster innovative ideas, and reform government institutions, enhance the government's efficiency so that the change of governmental functions can serves the needs of building a new type of city.

DE fitness landscapes; NK model; performance; technological innovation
ID PERSPECTIVE
AB This paper adopts a fitness landscape approach to study technological innovation management. Central to this approach is the notion of contingent fit between its contextual variables. Building on Kauffman's NK model, the paper explores how this theory relates to technological innovation management, and see innovation as a process of recombination search over technological landscape. It discusses four basic elements of technological innovation system: strategy, organization, culture and resource; analyzes the roles these elements play in the system. Basing on the survey of 103 manufacturing enterprises in Guangdong Province in China, the paper explores how the accumulation and interaction among these elements impact innovation landscape. By applying fitness landscape theory in technological innovation management, it will help enterprises formulate appropriate strategies by searching and selecting various combinations of innovation system elements.

DE west China; agricultural science & technology system; reform
AB West China is the focus and difficult part of new socialist countryside construction. The key of new socialist countryside construction is to deepen the reform of Agricultural Science & Technology System of West China, and to build a modem agricultural system. Presently, West China lags behind the average national level in terms of agricultural production and science & technology. Besides the common problems in China, West China has its own particular disadvantages in the agricultural scientific research and the science & technology system. For this reason, it needs further deepening the reform of Agricultural Science & Technology System of West China, particularly giving attention to the following aspects: (1) Continue transforming government functions, i.e. further turn government functions from micro-interference to macro-control, from administrative control to policy guidance, to strengthen overall integration of the scientific & technological innovation system of West China, and to guide innovation factors to form an effective interactive mechanism. First, determine development strategy of agricultural science and technology as well as key points of agricultural scientific & technological innovations in West China, and build an agricultural scientific & technological research and development (R&D) system with rational overall layout, distinct structure, and coordination & efficiency; secondly, build a scientific and effective science & technology input and evaluation system; thirdly, cooperate with East China, and build a public platform of scientific & technological research and development, and of personnel training, to realize share of resources equipment and personnel training opportunities. (2) Build a scientific & technological innovation system with agricultural enterprises as the mainstay. (3) Based on actual conditions of West China, conduct system innovation according to local conditions. For example, try to introduce the scientific & technological special person system into the promotion system of agricultural science & technology.

AB Knowledge flow in national innovation systems refers to knowledge flow inside and between the system elements such as enterprises, colleges and research institutions. The substance of knowledge flow lies in promoting effective combinations of innovation elements and improving innovation capabilities of innovation systems. Knowledge flow in national innovation systems can help better realize the value of knowledge, but the knowledge flow motivations of various behavior subjects and individuals in the organization are different at a certain level, and some of them are even contradictory. Knowledge flows are gradually becoming organized activities and the governments of different countries all strive to improve the efficiency of knowledge flow with a series of system arrangements.

AB Dual-use technology transfer plays a great role to implement the strategy of military-civilian integration in China. Yet, many transfer attempts are unsuccessful, with failures attributed to many differences between military and civil system. The purpose of this paper is to discuss dual-use technology transfer faced by defense companies for a better understanding of the difficulties associated with transfer efforts. Fist we give the definition and model of dual-use technology transfer, then the difference between military markets and civilian markets is analyzed in detail, also a specific conceptual framework for analyzing the transfer dilemma is suggested. Such a framework may help defense companies during the decision-making process while considering transitions into civilian markets and serve as a basis for additional research on the defense transfer dilemma. Finally three different specific strategies and a dual-use policy system are discussed in this paper. We conclude that successful dual-use transfer depend on both company strategy and dual policies of the government.

AB The high-tech enterprises in China fall short of innovation ability. The innovation ability is quite different from region to region. In particular, Small and Medium Businesses which are the main part of the enterprises flub in this part. Aiming at this situation, it constructs a common innovation system model about intellectual property based on TRIZ for the first time in this paper. TRIZ is a problem solving system based on the evolution rule of technology system, it is the accessorial tool which can help people to innovate. Consisting of technology system, cooperation system and security system, the system model degrades the otherness of different regions to innovate and exerts designers' creativity fully. With this system model, the innovation resource of intellectual property can be shared, the speed to innovate independently is improved, and the cost of independent innovation is reduced.

AB The appropriateness of the intellectual property system has great influence on the formation and success of the national technology innovation system. In national innovation system, the intellectual property system is an innovation impetus. It is used in the entire process of the technology innovation. Meanwhile, much importance must be attached to the interest balance between the creators and the users of new knowledge again, for the stringent intellectual property system may impede the spread of knowledge.

   social sciences and markets
AB Economy- and technology-driven theories dominate current explanations of social change. The political orientations of the European Union and many of its member states are increasingly based on the idea of knowledge economy where public organisations move towards market-orientation. Among the other producers of knowledge, universities are expected to become part of the innovation system where innovation stands for product making and the final goal is to contribute to the international competitiveness of the national economy.
   This study focuses on the complicated role of public universities as adaptors of market forces logic. The focus of attention is on the reorientations that Finnish universities have made in terms of commodification. At the same time universities have elaborated new aggressive strategies in order to strengthen their scientific basis and to distance themselves from the demands for new managerialism. One of the key problems in this process is related to the difficulties to integrate the two traditional university functions into the third one, i.e. commercialisation. We make some observations concerning EU policies, but concentrate mostly on changes that have taken place during recent decades in Finland by analysing market-orientation in three Helsinki area universities.
   In the context of current technology policy, all disciplines have been seen as potential contributors to market competition. However, social sciences produce knowledge that cannot be classified by using pure economic concepts. To sharpen our analysis of market-orientation we study three social science departments at the respective three universities. This analysis indicates the importance of scientific identity as a component of market-orientation. It also shows the importance of contextual issues and the tensions that arise between scientific and commercial orientations.

AB The main aim of the paper is to provide an alternative paradigm of transition of the Croatian economy towards knowledge economy, which is based on the concept of national innovation system and innovation policy. Following this aim, the main differences between the liberal neo-classical and evolutionary-institutional approach to technical change and economic growth are discussed. The process of transformation of technical change from an exogenous to endogenous phenomenon is explained as well as the process of the emergence of the "new innovation paradigm". It serves as an argument for considering economic growth as a phenomenon deeply embedded in socio-cultural and institutional context, and not the power beyond it. The role of state, political elite and policy in general is emphasized as essential for shaping economic growth. The paper claims that the Croatian political and managerial elites are utterly deficient in knowing how to initiate economic growth based on knowledge since they neglect the importance of institutional and socio-cultural conditions of development. Their policy actions are limited to the standard science policy instead of introduction of the innovation policy. In order to prove the thesis, the critical overview of the role of the Program HITRA, the first innovation policy program in Croatia, is presented. The selected statistical indicators to illustrate the main features of the Croatian innovation and research system are also provided. The paper concludes that so-called social ability for growth and political learning is the basic mechanism for overcoming the current institutional inertia. Those factors determine, also, the dynamics of transition to knowledge economy.

New technologies are often more efficiently harnessed through the creation of new enterprises and the redesign of existing ones, both factors depending on the entrepreneurial environment".
   The innovation infrastructure bridges the research system and the innovation drivers, basically including: incubators, which provide basic infrastructure for start-ups; technological parks, which provide experimental facilities; the knowledge market (transfer of intellectual property and technological transfer). Different combinations of -these elements might be imagined, including financing channels, but again, for more relevance, we will stick here to the theoretical classification. Aiming at building a innovation-based economy is a rational goal for any state. This is the path to competitiveness, growth and economic prosperity.

AB One of the key prerequisites for the successful development of knowledge-based economy is the unity of scientific research and the practical implementation of results (innovation processes). The article maintains that the main methodological principles ensuring this unity are the following: setting research priority areas, development of organizational structures ensuring the unity of research and innovation, enhancement of research and innovation funding mechanisms, and management optimization of these processes.
   In setting research priority areas it is especially important that objective criteria are chosen. The article proves that the most significant criteria are the economical strategy, natural resources, scientific potential of the country as well as general changes in global science development.
   The most important element in the development of organizational structures ensuring the unity between research and innovation is the establishment of the national research and innovation system. The most effective way to enhance funding of this unity is a rational combination of direct budget and private sector funding with indirect fiscal and catalytic financial means.
   In order to improve the management of research and innovation processes, a special attention should be given to creation and development of modern forms of administration (network, spherical, matrix structures, spin-off companies, clusters, etc.).
   The article emphasises that only systematic and integrated application of all proposed measures can produce the desired results in ensuring research and innovation unity, therefore the implementation of this prerequisite is of the utmost importance for the development of knowledge-based economy.

AB This chapter highlights and investigates potential knowledge spillovers from a patent office. It furthermore discusses if such spillovers are localized within the nation. It researches if the interaction between the applicant firms and the patent office, in this case the Danish Patent and Trademark Office (DKPTO), adds to the general competence of both parties. In turn, this may have positive long-term effects on the ability of the firms to innovate and use the intellectual property rights (IPR) system.
   Patent offices are often regarded as performing relatively standardized processing of applications without much interaction with other parties in the innovation system. On the contrary, the research reveals that the DKPTO not only grants patents and sells business services, but also has a complementary role as a knowledge-diffusing organization.
   A survey was implemented to explore this role in the innovation system further. The general impact of the DKPTO on knowledge diffusion is, according to the survey, primarily to increase the awareness of IPR among firms and to bring together the IPR branch by constituting a central focus point for common interests. Additionally, the DKPTO serves a role in facilitating easy access to the patent system for firms by lowering the cultural and linguistic barriers of IPR protection. Moreover, the DKPTO educates patent engineers who after a period in the DKPTO are employed in other organizations. The role of the DKPTO in terms of stimulating innovation directly is modest, but the above-mentioned complementary functions are likely to produce considerable knowledge spillovers. On the basis of the results the organization of a European patent system is discussed, specifically whether a centralization of the patenting process would deprive nation states of the knowledge spillovers from a national location of patent offices. The conclusion from the study is that although many Danish firms would be able to do without a national patent office with regard to the patenting process, there is still a role for national IPR institutions.

AB This chapter attempts to look at the role of IPRs in different innovation systems - national, sectoral, corporate, university and military systems - in a governance perspective. The rapid advent of the pro-IP era from the 1980s on, embedded in the gradual emergence of a new type of economy dominated by intellectual capital, has generally transformed and strengthened various IP regimes in these innovation systems, with an increasing use of patent and licensing oriented regimes.
   The availability of enforceable and valuable IPRs together with more large-scale R&D and complex new technologies, calling for more inter-firm technology collaborations and various forms of technology trade (through licences, small firms, services and so on) have fostered quasi-integrated corporate innovation systems. Seen in a governance perspective the IPR approach creates governance tools but also governance problems, but so do other approaches to incentivizing and coordinating innovative activities as well. A re-evaluation of various approaches is needed, focusing on both incentivizing and coordinating functions, for sustaining efficient and effective innovation systems.

ID EMBEDDEDNESS
AB Lately, many governments have been promoting a large number of projects to develop regions as a solution of a) the globalisation of production and b) the change of locus from resource based economy to knowledge based economy. This is observable in e.g. Sweden where public actors on national, regional and local levels have identified the need for the government to address the globalisation and knowledge economy trends. These efforts have been facilitated by organizing co-operating concepts such as 'cluster initiatives', 'triple helix' and 'innovation systems'. However, a closer look on regional development initiatives reveals that they are organised as projects. Therefore, from a regional government point of view, there is a challenge in managing multi-project milieus in an environment consisting of different institutional interests.
   The significance of multi-project management for economic activity has grown considerably since the 1990s. However, there is still little understanding of the nature and composition of managing multi project in regional development context, especially from a government perspective. This paper Will address this deficiency by describing and examining how regional governments act when managing multi-project initiatives. The paper suggests that the main function of the concepts is to mobilise, but not to guide, action. Thus organisations with different logics and goals can co-operate in joint projects.

AB With the advent of the knowledge economy, the key competition of economy and comprehensive national power among the nations in the world is the science and technology, and the competition focus on the high-tech and relevant industries. Developing high-tech industries is becoming a national highlighting. The primary mission of the high-tech region is to accelerate the development of high-tech industry, and promote the national comprehensive competitive power. Such as the development demands put forward by Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, the high-tech region should further take advantage of its important base of the high-tech industrialization, strive to become the important carrier to promote the technological progress and increase the independent innovative capability, strive to become a powerful engine to adjust regional economic structure and transform economic growth mode, strive to become a service platform for high-tech enterprises to go abroad to take part in international competition, and strive to become the front-line position to race to occupy the commanding point of world high-tech industry. The improvement of independent innovation capability is the fundamental guarantee for high-tech region to implement its function and realize its development request of "quaternity". From the concept of innovation, aiming at the improvement of independent innovation capability in high-tech region, this essay constructs an independent innovation system which integrates the government, scientific research institutes, universities, intermediaries, corporations, financial institutions based on the analysis on the four competitive factors and six participant subjects.

AB Stimulating new industries from emerging technologies is central to successful high-tech based economic growth, employment, competition and sustainability in modem market economies. The Taiwanese experiences in developing new technology-based industries (e.g. integrated circuits, personal computers, notebooks, scanners, and TFF LCDs) illustrate some of the ways policy makers can shape the development of emerging technologies into new industries. These ways of actions are manifold, but at least policy attentions to three key mechanisms are critical. These mechanisms encourage partnership in the commercialization process, foster entrepreneurship and venture initiatives in the innovation system, and sustain commercialization and the creation of new firms. The study of Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan on biochips and nanotechnology further shows how the policy makers can build a statutory body to effectively address the functions of three mechanisms as a whole.

AB The literature on systems of innovation conceptualises innovation as an evolutionary and social process of collective learning. But three main questions remain open: is this learning process rather internal or external? What are the boundaries of this process? Is this social process voluntary or rather unintended? This paper strives to tackle those questions by analysing the determinants of regional innovative levels in French manufacturing industries. By estimating a knowledge production function we find that building external interactions is of greater importance than developing internal innovative competences. Second, unintended knowledge flows have less influence on regional innovative performance than deliberate ones. Lastly, the French innovation system looks regional rather than sectoral.

AB The article discusses the condition and perspective of the European Union in the knowledge economy and the feasibility of the goal given by the European Council at the summits held in Lisbon (March 2000) and Barcelona (March 2002), that is, to increase European R&D expenditure to 3 per cent of GDP by 2010. The article focuses on two aspects: comparative performance with its direct counterparts, in particular the USA; and intra-European distribution of resources and capabilities. A set of technological indicators is presented to show that Europe is still consistently behind when compared to Japan and the US, especially in R&D investment and the generation of innovations. A small convergence occurs in the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs), the sector most directly linked to the concept of the 'new economy'. In the field of knowledge collaboration, Europe takes opposing paths in the business and academic worlds. Within Europe, the level of investment in scientific and technological activities is so diverse across countries that it does not merge into a single continental innovation system.

AB China, since the beginning of its 'open door' policy, has done much to reform its National Innovation System, recognising that its ambitious agenda for science and technology could only delivered by a focus on the regional. In 1988 China's first science park, by far the largest in Asia, was created at Zhongguancun Science Park (ZSP) near Beijing. ZSP was established following visits by Chinese scientists to Route 128 and Silicon Valley in the USA, and the importation of perceived best practice to China. ZSP is analysed as a Regional Innovation System, comprising high-technology firms and institutional infrastructure within five clusters. This approach highlights the interactions and knowledge flows between the elements of the system. The five clusters comprise: high technology entrepreneurs/enterprises, institutions, support endowments, government and intermediaries clusters, each of which is made up of a number of elements. ZSP closely interacts with China's NIS, some national R&D laboratories and a number of national universities located within the science park.

AB This article focuses on knowledge creation and management in regional innovation networks. A knowledge management system for a regional innovation network is designed. Besides explicit and tacit knowledge, self-transcending knowledge is taken into account within the knowledge management system. In addition, considerations of knowledge vision as well as methods from futures studies are incorporated into the system. An innovation network of the Lahti regional innovation system, Finland, is used as a case example in the article. The article highlights the importance of combining loose network development and an explicit, systematic approach to planning and working on knowledge-related matters within regional innovation networks.

AB Local innovation networks are considered to be important to innovation and technological change and to growth prospects of regions and cities in Germany. When analysing the local ( or regional) innovation system, one should consequently not only investigate horizontal and vertical relations among firms but also the contacts with universities and other research institutions. Furthermore, the role of government agencies and interest groups that provide financial support as well as commercial and technical information should also be taken into account. However, the review of relevant theoretical and empirical investigations related to the German experience shows that such innovation and R&D cooperation networks appear to be less significant than expected. In general various regional technology policy measures adopted in German states ( the provision of research infrastructure, establishment of technology centres, innovative small and medium sized enterprises support programmes, etc.) have been more successful in economically better-off large cities than in the rural areas. Apart from offering a critical review of relevant theoretical and empirical research, this study introduces the present regional technology and R&D promotion policies in German states and examines the local innovation systems, taking Landshut as an example.

AB This paper explores economic development financing and action, an important policy arena if lesser expenditure field in the devolved administrations. It sets evolution of this in historical and theoretical context. Since devolution in 1999, manufacturing job loss has been a common fear in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales as the UK government, even from 1997, pursued a strong sterling policy outside the Eurozone. In Northern Ireland, development options have been further constrained by suspension of Stormont, and Whitehall demands to reduce public administration. In Scotland a bold 'knowledge economy' strategy is evolving around endogenous growth; while in Wales, the Welsh Development Agency and other 'quangos' are to be absorbed into the Assembly government as elements of an endogenous innovation system policy falter. Simultaneously, public administration employment has grown particularly rapidly in Wales as the Assembly Government has perforce swiftly absorbed Keynesian counter-cyclical resources from the UK government.

TI From technology transfer to the emergence of a triple helix culture: The
   experience of Algeria in innovation and technological capability
   development
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on the post-independence industrialization experience of Algeria, this paper explores the need for and the challenges and prospects of shifts of policies and strategies from central planning to decentralization and liberalization; from a heavy industry-dominated scenario to one dominated by SMEs; and from reliance on technology transfer to the development of a culture of innovation and technological learning. The paper highlights the business incubation system as an aspect of the triple helix model of innovation in which universities, industry, government and non-government organizations feature as principal actors in the national innovation system. The paper notes the need for both technology transfer and the development of the triple helix culture in developing countries. It also underlines the need for policy in developing countries to ensure that the former played only a residual role, while the latter took the lead in providing for the development of a culture of innovation. The culture of bureaucracy and institutional fragmentation has been a major factor militating against initiatives for technological capability development; and the conventional technology transfer practice has reinforced this culture. A major policy initiative is needed in developing countries to put the national system of innovation in place and remove the constraints on the development of the triple helix culture.

TI Do patents facilitate financing in the software industry?
SO TEXAS LAW REVIEW

DT Article
ID INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; LAW; INNOVATION; ANTICOMMONS; ECONOMICS;
   SCOPE; ORGANIZATIONS; PROTECTION; MARKETS; SYSTEM
AB This Article is the first part of a wide study of the role of intellectual property in the software industry. Unlike previous papers that focus primarily on software patents-which generally are held by firms that are not software firms-this Article provides a thorough and contextually grounded description of the role that patents play in the software industry itself.
   The bulk of the Article considers the pros and cons of patents in the software industry. The Article starts by emphasizing the difficulties that prerevenue startups face in obtaining any value from patents. Litigation to enforce patents is impractical,for those firms. Efforts to obtain patents divert the firm's focus from the central task of designing and deploying a product, and the benefits of excluding competitors are limited for firms that cannot themselves exploit the relevant technology. Once the firm is larger, a number of potential benefits appear. First, despite concerns that patents are not effective to appropriate profits from innovation in the software industry, a substantial number of software startups do have patents of sufficient strength to exclude competitors. That important finding, taken with the fact that the principal targets of those patents are much larger firms, suggests patents are more beneficial to small firms than to large firms. The Article then considers indirect effects related to the use of patents in cross-licensing transactions and in providing information about the firm. The first benefit may be substantial to firms that obtain patents, but the Article rejects patent use in cross-licensing as a net benefit to the industry: absent some other benefit, all firms would be better off saving the costs of obtaining patents. The information benefits, in contrast, seem to be net improvements to the innovation system. The central question, which I do not attempt to answer here, is whether those benefits are sufficiently substantial to justify the costs of obtaining the patents.
   The Article then turns to the prominent claims that the enforcement of software patents has hindered innovation in the software industry through creation of a patent "thicket." The Article rejects those claims for two broad reasons. First, notwithstanding the empirical analysis of RTD spending in papers by Bessen, Maskin, and Hunt, direct evidence of high RTD spending in the software industry undermines claims that software patents cause firms to reduce RTD spending. Second, the actual structure and practices of the industry belie any claim of a patent thicket. Relying on interviews that I conducted and publicly available information, I show that the development of young firms in the software industry is not significantly constrained by large patent portfolios in the hands of incumbent firms.
   The Article also contextualizes the role of patents by examining the relatively weak protections that copyright and trade secret afford At bottom, neither of those systems can provide a useful mechanism that allows small firms to appropriate the values of their inventions. If such protection is a significant positive benefit of the patent system, it is equally true that neither copyrights nor trade secrets contribute (or can contribute) significantly in that respect, however useful they might be in other roles (such as preventing piracy).
   The Article closes by considering critically the possibility of middle ground responses that would limit patent rights in the industry but not abolish them entirely. First, I criticize a possible registration system that might provide information benefits without the costs of excluding competitors. I argue that such an approach is impractical both because it would be difficult to disentangle the information benefits from the right to control technology and because of my sense that software firms would have an inadequate incentive to participate in such a system. Second, I consider the possibility of special limits on the rights of "trolls," small nonoperating firms formed solely to litigate patents. Trolls serve a useful function as specialized intermediaries and thus in fact may have a positive role in promoting innovation in the industry. Third, I consider the possibility that slight alterations in the patent rules for enablement and disclosure might mitigate the risks trolls pose to the licensing equilibrium that currently minimizes the costs of patenting in the software industry.

AB In this paper, the university-industry research collaborations under the Japanese innovation system are discussed from the viewpoint of external funding and on the basis of public and detailed data. First, the trends in joint research, contract research, and research through donations are clarified by time series. The contract content including the ownership of the intellectual property in joint research is clearly defined. Therefore, joint research is essential for university-industry collaborations. The characteristics of companies and researchers that engage in joint research projects are analyzed based on detailed data from Niigata University. The results reveal that the joint research projects are properly characterized by scale, location, and industry sector.

DE patenting activity; National Innovation System; WIPO; Central and East
   European countries
AB A patent is the main result of R&D activities and the first step in the creation of intellectual property rights (IPR) system in a country. Patenting culture is predefined by the level of development of a particular National Innovation System (NIS), compatibility of country's IPR law with internationally adopted standards and norms and embedded innovation capacities and entrepreneurial behavior of individuals, organizations and institutions. Patenting activity in selected Central and East European (CEE) countries is analyzed in order to identify patterns of resident as well as non-resident patenting in these countries. Transformation of original patent data grouped under IPC (International Patent Classification) as WIPO defined units, into sectoral (HC-Harmonized Classification of sectors of economy) patent data using OECD proposed concordance programme, modified by the author for the use of publicly available national patent data, is made for a preliminary analysis of the validity of proposed transformation, as well as for the analysis of innovation capacity built into manufacturing sectors of transition economies.

DE technology diffusion policy; evolvement; classification; innovation
AB Technology diffusion practices can be traced back to the early 1960s. Developed countries now consider technology diffusion policy to be a critical part of macro-technology policy and an essential element of national innovation system. Yong-Tae Park from South Korea studied technology diffusion policies in some developed countries, and analyzed the evolvement stages and classification schemes of technology diffusion policy. Based on that, this paper conducts researches on the technology diffusion policy innovation in China.

AB This paper reviews literature on strategic management of technology in Japanese firms. The paper is divided into five sections, namely:
   1 technology strategy
   2 inter-firm technological relations
   3 knowledge management
   4 new product development
   5 Japanese innovation system and policy.
   We examine literature on technology strategy, including, general strategy, studies on de facto standard, global technology strategy, and studies on small high-tech firms. Then, we investigate inter-firm relations, such as keiretsu and supplier management, technological alliances, spin-offs, and R&D consortia. Finally, we review studies on new product development processes and tools, and technology policy, followed by implications for further research.

AB This paper discusses the technology transfer being adapted in the agriculture and agribusiness sectors for sustainability and economic growth. It investigates the motives and achievements of technology transfer in the Caribbean and comes up with a generic agro-innovation model. Empirical findings obtained and experience gained in Caribbean countries will be presented. The proposed model adopts the national innovation system approach that stresses the importance of interactions and interdependence between elements of the economy. These elements are the key stakeholders including agro-firms, knowledge institutions and government agencies whose relationships are characterized by reciprocity, interactivity and feedback mechanisms. The paper describes the development of, and explains the building components of the model. The efficacy of using and evaluating the model is also discussed.

AB A very rich collection of archival material is used to compare two anticancer drugs commercialised by multinationals collaborating with public sector research, one in the USA and one in France. The framework of national innovation systems is used to compare the innovative environments for each development (different institutional structures. research programmes, financing, industry-academic-government relationships, environmental concern, and intellectual property, regimes). The empirical work was able to bring out the nuances and subtleties of each environment, the way in which innovation took place in practice, and some striking differences from what stereotypical accounts of innovation in each country would have suggested.

AB Changes in epistemology in biosciences are generating important spatial effects. The most notable of these is the emergence of a few 'Bioscience Megacentres' for basic and applied bioscience medical and clinical research (molecular, post-genomic, proteomics, etc.), biotechnology research, training in these and related fields, academic entrepreneurship and commercial exploitation by clusters of 'drug discovery' start-up and spin-off companies, along with specialist venture capital and other innovation system support services. Large pharmaceutical firms that used to lead such knowledge generation and exploitation processes are becoming increasingly dependent upon innovative drug solutions produced in such clusters, and megacentres are now the predominant source of such commercial knowledge. 'Big pharma' is seldom at the heart of megacentres such as those the paper will argue are found in about four locations each in the USA and Europe, but remains important for some risk capital ('milestone payments), marketing, and distribution of drugs discovered. The embedding of these processes also creates major new regional disparities, which some regional governances have recognised, causing them to develop responsibilities for regional science policy and funding to offset spatial biases intrinsic in traditional national (and in the EU, supranational) research funding regimes. Responses follow a variety of models ranging from market:following to both regionalised (decentralising by the centre) and 'regionalist' (ground-up); in each case, the role of megacentres is justified in health terms. But their role in assisting fulfilment of regional economic growth visions is also clearly perceived and pronounced in policy terms.

AB Appropriate demand articulation of emerging technologies to social needs are vital to the economic and social productivity, and it is essential to grasp the future trends of social needs and technology advancement to promote the strategic technology policy. Japan embarked on technology foresight in the early 1970s and has since been conducting a regular Delphi survey approximately every 5 years. To explore a new intelligent methodology for integrating technological seeds and social needs by articulating future demands, this paper reviews the following two cases: the Delphi-scenario writing (DSW) method, which is applied in 1977 for the home/office small facsimile, and the method of general assessment applied in 1972 for informationalization, which focused on the rapidly advancing information society, with a matrix scoring and policy-simulation method. Those new approaches were proved to be a powerful methodology to integrate the technology forecasting and assessment for comprehensive understanding of the emerging technologies and their social impacts in the form of integrated technology road mapping, which supports the integrated strategic planning methodology for enhancing the future innovation system.

DE innovation system; Taiwan; China; institution; research and development;

AB This paper presents an analytical framework to compare two distinguishing innovation systems. For recognizing the structural characteristics of innovation systems, six major functions of generic types of institutions involved in the systems are examined: policy formulation, performing R&D, financing R&D, promotion of human resource development, technology bridging, and promotion of technological entrepreneurship. Not only does it describe the role and performance of particular institutions, but this framework also explores four major interactions among these institutions for illustrating the dynamics and efficiency of innovation systems, that is, R&D collaboration, informal interaction, technology diffusion, and personnel mobility.
   The framework is applied to compare the innovation systems of Taiwan and China, revealing that they both have unique characteristics, while also sharing numerous complementary features. In addition, the two economies have the linguistic, cultural, racial and historical similarities, plus their geographical proximity. Consequently, these phenomena suggest the possibility of future cooperation between the two innovation systems, and then this paper proposes possible approaches to achieving cooperation for the two sides.

AB The concept of the National System of Innovation (NSI) has been applied in order to analyze the interrelation of institutions and technological development. It has been diversified as a growing number of studies recognized the emergence of autonomous innovation systems at various territorial levels. Focusing on German biotechnology, this article takes an alternative perspective arguing that functions of the NSI became part of a multi-level governance system. By proposing a multi-level approach, which directs on the dynamic reconfiguration of NSIs towards the subnational as well as the international level, we are trying to bridge the gap between innovation system approaches that analytically highlight one specific territorial level only.

AB This paper analyses the nature of industrial and technological development in Hong Kong in order to tease out the modes of innovation that existed in this Asian Newly Industrialised Economy (ANIE) since the 1950s to the present. The mode of innovation in Hong Kong from the early 1950s to mid-1990s was systemic in nature and that it conforms to a variant of the national innovation system (NIS). Embedded in the export-led industrialisation of Hong Kong is a framework of innovation that is different from the other ANIEs - South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. Since the mid-1990s, and especially after the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, Hong Kong's innovation system has been more interactive and horizontal, which has some family resemblance to the 'Triple Helix' government-industry-university system, which is a stylised version of NIS. The new innovation system is dynamic and appears to have been driven by an apparent objective of steering Hong Kong in the direction of an innovation-driven economy.

AB This paper examines the relationship between Clustering and long distance partnering from the perspective of evolutionary economics and the innovation systems literature. Specifically, it brings into this framework business and management approaches and regional economic theories to analyse the preference for colocation in clusters and the extensiveness and degree of complementarity or substitutability between long distance and local partnerships pursued by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the biotechnology sector. The study covers the partnering activity of 25 dedicated biotechnology SMEs located in six clusters on the periphery of France.

AB Identifying emerging technologies, participating in the across-organizational learning process, and getting familiar with emerging technologies and markets are essential for gaining and sustaining competitive advantages for technology-based companies. How to effectively integrate the management of emerging technologies into existing innovation system of a firm is perhaps the toughest issue for most companies [2][5]. In this paper, having reviewed several innovation models, we introduce roadmapping technique that evolves from technology forecasting, to technology planning to technology management over times. The roadmapping technique can serve as an integrating process for total technology management ranged from emerging technology to varied process technologies for improving firms' competitive capabilities.

   organization; learning society
AB On the one hand, new economy is knowledge economy which is based on knowledge generated, knowledge distributed and knowledge applied from the approach of denseness of economy development elements, on the other hand, new economy is learning economy in which learning is an important activity, from the approach of function of learning and innovation in economy development, as the performance of economy development is directly decided by learning and innovation. Learning region, learning organization and learning society are the corresponding concepts, which separately describes innovation system at the various levels. Learning organization emphasizes microcosmic organizational learning. Learning region emphasizes moderate social learning. Learning society emphasizes macro social learning. Learning organization is the microcosmic innovation system, which is at the organizational level. Learning society is the macro innovation system, which is at the national level. Learning region is not only the moderate innovation system, which is at the regional level, but also a kind of effective regional innovation system, which is the new mode of regional economy development. However, at the present time, it is come to light that some regional innovation systems in our country face the failure of their regional innovation systems during the economy development. Based on the case, we point out that the effective way to solve the problem of the failure of regional innovation system is to establish learning region. At first, this paper separately defines the three various learning processes of individual learning, organizational learning and social learning. Secondly, it illustrates that learning region is the effective regional innovation system on the base of deeply discussing the concept and characteristics of learning region. At last, using the ten policy principles put forward by OECD for reference, it brings forward the concrete measures to successfully establish learning region, which is accorded with our country's situation.

AB Combining the theory of ecosystem and the regional technological innovation system (RTIS), this paper puts for-ward a new concept: regional technological innovation ecosystem (RTIE), which consists of the technological innovation compound body and composite environment in a region. RTIE with some ecological characteristics has provided such a good approach that we can use ecology metaphor for in making scientific researches on RTIS. RTIE is a very large complex system to such an extent as to we couldn't analyze every perspective of it. So the paper only focuses on the regulation mechanisms of RTIE that includes the stability mechanism, the diversity mechanism, and the static state equilibrium mechanism.

TI From citadels to clusters: the evolution of regional innovation policies
   in Australia

CL LEUVEN, BELGIUM
AB In Australia, the federal (central) and State (regional) governments share constitutional responsibility for aspects of science and innovation policy. In practice, the federal government has tended to overshadow the States both in funding and policy for research and innovation. It can be argued that we are now seeing the strong rebirth of regionalism (at least at the State level) as far as government support for science, technology and knowledge-based industries is concerned. The paper traces the growth of regional innovation policies through examples of initiatives from South Australia and other regions and examines the respective contributions of the State and federal governments. The character of State government support has evolved over the last 15 years, from sponsoring grand 'technology citadels' to today's strategies that take a more bottom-up approach to building intense innovation environments, local clusters and knowledge hubs. Some of these trends reflect the influence of the global knowledge economy on regional industries, while others (notably the relative decline of the federal government as an R&D performer) are peculiarities of the Australian innovation system. The outcome is a significant evolution in Australia's innovation system, one which parallels responses to globalisation in other countries and suggests a different - but not diminished role for public sector innovation policy.

AB This article examines the emerging field of today's superscience-biotechnology-within the context of the national innovation system of one small country, namely Finland. This context is explored primarily through the practices of one particular Finnish biotechnology center BioCity. The Silicon Valley rhetoric, which every self-respecting technology project around the world seems to incorporate into its own vocabulary, is compared with the everyday "reality" of this biotechnology center The article focuses on the implementation of technology policy, organized following the "triple helix" model, in the field of biotechnology. Some comparisons with different countries are also made to give a picture of Finland in relation with the European life sciences industry. The article is concluded by a consideration of the future prospects of BioCity and Finnish biotechnology.

AB We examine the geographic co-location of university research and industrial R&D in three technology areas. While we find strong evidence of co-location of these vertically connected activities, regional economies appear to vary markedly in their ability to convert local academic research into local commercial innovation. We develop and test the hypothesis that the presence of a large, local, R&D-intensive firm-an anchor tenant-enhances the regional innovation system such that local university research is more likely to be absorbed by and to stimulate local industrial RD.

AB Regional innovation system (RIS) is the new research field of modem economic geography in the age of knowledge economy. Based on the researches of regional economic geography, the authors of the paper consider RIS as the integrated and interactive systems with innovation milieu, elements, units, structure and functions. Five aspects of evaluation indicators including innovation input scale and output scale, innovation milieu transition, innovation inner operation, as well as innovation outer impact are worked out for final indicators of RIS scale and quality. According to different RIS situations, three patterns of independent, imitative and cooperative development are put forward for choosing. At the latter part of the paper, we select 12 provincial regions (including three municipalities and one autonomous region) of China for empirical study. The results show that there exists great difference among each region from the aspects of innovation scale and quality mainly owning to the diversification of RIS social and economic milieu, the major innovative units of enterprises, universities and R&D institutes. Finally, the paper points out the innovation development decisions for each region.

   innovation system; political system
AB In Europe, public research, technology and innovation policies are no longer exclusively in the hands of national authorities: increasingly, national initiatives are supplemented by, or even competing with, regional innovation policies or transnational programmes, in particular the activities of the European Union. At the same time, industrial innovation increasingly occurs within international networks. Are we witnessing a change of governance in European innovation policy? Based on some theoretical assumptions concerning the relationship between the "political systems" and "innovation systems" in Europe, the paper speculates about the future governance of innovation policies, trying to pave ways for empirical analyses. It sketches three scenarios stretching from (1) the idea of an increasingly centralised and dominating European innovation policy arena to (2) the opposite, i.e., a progressive decentralisation and open competition between partly strengthened, partly weakened national or regional innovation systems and finally to (3) the vision of a centrally "mediated" mixture of competition and cooperation between diverse regional innovation cultures and a related governance structure.

AB Brazil is considered to have an immature national innovation system. One significant situation that contributes to it is that Brazil concentrates its research efforts and inventiveness in academic environments, while the private sector has very little access to this activity. Measures are being taken to correct this situation. Nevertheless, scientists' attitudes towards the new situation will be instrumental for the success of such measures. For this reason, we have studied the behavior of Brazilian scientists from the biotechnological fields concerning Intellectual Property Rights. In this research 1032 researchers were electronically contacted and 150 responded. The 41 questions include indicators about the interviewees' perceptions about their institutions' support for patenting research results, their attitudes towards recent changes in Intellectual Property Rights legislation and about the interaction of researchers with demands from external interests.

AB This paper, combining the theories of ecology and the regional technological innovation system (RTIS), first advances a new concept: the regional technological innovation ecosystem (RTIE), which consists of the composite organizations and the organizations with a composite environment for regional technological innovation. RTIS with characteristics and regularities of the ecosystem has provided us with a new thought for the study of RTIE. The discussion will only focus on the restrictive factors of various kinds in RTIE, i.e. the technological factors, the market factors, ecological environment factors as well as system and policy factors, and how composite organizations cope with the changes of restrictive factors in the system along with the strategies that they should take for adaptation to these changes.

AB It is a commonly held view that differences in national histories, cultures, political contexts, and the timing of a country's entry into the industrialization process are reflected as diversity among countries in their goals, priorities, boundaries, directions, ranges, instruments and also in the performance of science and technology policy. This article, which examines development processes of Finnish science and technology policy, concludes that instead of divergence there is such startling convergence of organizational forms and practices. Finland has largely adopted its policy doctrines and instruments from the countries, which from the Finnish perspective, have been considered legitimate and successful. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In spite of the diffusion of science parks in Europe, it is still unclear whether they have been successful in fostering the establishment and growth of new technology-based firms (NTBFs). This paper aims to contribute to answer such question. For this purpose, a sample composed of 45 Italian NTBFs which at the beginning of 2000 were located on technology incubator within a park is compared with a control sample of off-incubator firms. Aspects considered in the study include the personal characteristics of founders of NTBFs, the motivations of the self-employment choice, the growth and innovative performances of firms, propensity towards networking, and access to public subsidies. In the comparison, we use a larger set of indicators than in previous studies. The empirical results confirm the conventional wisdom that input and output measures of innovative activity are only marginally different between on- and off-incubator firms. Nonetheless, they also show that Italian parks managed to attract entrepreneurs with better human capital, as measured by educational attainments and prior working experience. In addition, on-incubator firms show higher growth rates than their off-incubator counterparts. They also perform better in terms of adoption of advanced technologies, aptitude to participating in international R&D programs, and establishment of collaborative arrangements, especially with universities. Lastly, they find it easier to get access to public subsidies. Altogether, such findings support the view that science parks are an important element of a technology policy in favor of NTBFs. This holds true especially in a country like Italy which is characterized by a rather weak national innovation system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stimulating new industries from emerging technologies is central to successful high-tech based economic growth, employment, competition and sustainability in modern market economies. The Chinese Taiwan's experiences in developing new technology-based industries (e.g., integrated circuits, personal computers, notebooks, scanners, and TFT LCDs) illustrates some of the ways policy makers can shape the development of emerging technologies into new industries. These ways of actions are manifold, but at least policy attentions to three key mechanisms are critical. These mechanisms speak to encourage partnership in the commercialization process, foster entrepreneurship and venture initiatives in the innovation system, and sustain the commercialization and the new firm creation. The case study of Chinese Taiwan ITRI further shows how the policy makers can build a statutory body to effectively address the functions of the three mechanisms as a whole.

AB Currently, hi-tech industry has been one of the main streams of new developing small and medium-sized enterprises. Promoted by the tide of technical entrepreneurship, which are carried out by researchers in the institutes and engineers in the companies, the discussion and research of technical entrepreneurship is regarded as one of the most important topics in the research of technology innovation system. However, the references of technical entrepreneurship inside our country and abroad always focus on the aspects of business plan, venture capital and investment return. This paper highlights the view of technical entrepreneurs (also including venture entrepreneurs), capitalists (also including venture capital firms) and ways adopted by research and developing organizations from the government through the analysis of drive force, which pushed the formation of technology management in hi-tech industry. In the meantime, it will go further into the following models existing in the Chinese technical companies such as the companies deriving from the R&D departments, the companies that technical entrepreneurs seek money to build up by themselves, the companies deriving from the technical entrepreneurship inside the big companies, the companies established by technology introduction or technology transfer, and the companies which capitalists cooperate with technical entrepreneurs in building up. In the end, the author of the paper intends to give the empirical evidence by suggesting five stages of how the technical companies develop dynamically (including the stage of idea, seed or plan, start-up, marketing and financial development) so as to give the key factors (including the sides of technology, financial capability, marketing/sales/service, human resource and so on) which play in every stages of technical entrepreneurship and offer the evaluation model of the life cycle of technical entrepreneurship.

AB Based on the analysis and evaluation of S-shaped diffusion model, this paper presents the evolutionary diffusion model for substitute technological innovation system, which involves firms' stochastic adoption behavior. And then, with MATHEMATICA 4.0 and ORIGIN 5.0 software, stochastic diffusion model is simulated. Finally through discussing the fixed station and evolutionary process, useful conclusions are drawn, which are very helpful to deeply understand the mechanism and rules of the substitute technological diffusion.

AB This paper is concerned with the dynamic of intervention by public authorities in the domain of research and innovation. It has a dual objective. On the one hand, it seeks to challenge the stereotyped image of the French system, presented in the literature as completely characterised by the dominant role of a Colbertist state (that is to say an interventionist model which places emphasis on the dominant weight of large civil and defence programmes, on the division between the universities and the CNRS, on the congenital separation between research and firms, on the monopolisation of public support by certain large industrial groups). Evolutionary changes are described, which prove that this classic image is no longer relevant in capturing the current dynamic of the French research and innovation system. On the other hand, this paper seeks to show that this challenge is a consequence of close examination of the relevance of the notion of "national policy for research and technology" itself. Alongside national policy, regional and European policies are emerging, the effects of which are so important that public intervention can no longer be seen only in terms of national policy.

AB This paper gives an overview of quantitative approaches used to study the science/technology linkage. Our discussion is informed by a number of theoretical approaches that have emerged over the past few years in the area of innovation studies emphasizing the exchange of actors in innovation system and a shift in the division of labour between publicly funded basic research and industrial development of technology. We review the more quantitative literature on efforts made to study such linkage phenomena, to which theorizing in the science policy area has attributed great importance. We then introduce a typology of three approaches to study the science/technology linkage - patent citation, industrial science, and university patenting. For each approach, we shall discuss merits and possible disadvantages. In another step we illustrate them using results from studies of the Finnish innovation system. Finally, we list key limitations of the informetric methods and point to possible hybrid approaches that could remedy some of them.

AB SMEs innovate in a different way to larger firms. They command fewer resources, have less R&D, and they generally face more uncertainties and barriers to innovation. These weaknesses could partly be overcome by their integration into networks and innovation systems. Due to the fact that interactions of SMEs are often informal and trust based, the region should be an important interaction and support-space for the innovation activities of SMEs. According to the empirical findings of a European TSER project (SMEPOL) this was not fully confirmed: SMEs are less often engaged in innovation networks than larger firms and if they have innovation partnerships they are primarily concentrated on business partners. Because relations to science and technology transfer are rare, SMEs make only limited use of the full potential of their respective regional innovation systems.

AB In Europe, public research, technology and innovation policies are no longer exclusively in the hands of national authorities: increasingly, national initiatives are supplemented by or even competing with regional innovation policies or transnational programmes, in particular, the activities of the European Union. At the same time, industrial innovation increasingly occurs within international networks. Are we witnessing a change of governance in European innovation policy? Based on a set of hypotheses concerning the co-evolution of "political systems" and "innovation systems" in Europe, the paper speculates about the future governance of innovation policies, trying to pave the ways for empirical analyses. It sketches three scenarios stretching from (1) the idea of an increasingly centralised and dominating European innovation policy arena to (2) the opposite, i.e. a progressive decentralisation and open competition between partly strengthened, partly weakened national or regional innovation systems, and finally to (3) the vision of a centrally "mediated" mixture of competition and co-operation between diverse regional innovation cultures and a related governance structure.

AB Technopreneurs are emerging in the New Economy; yet Australia has a relatively weak innovation system. Authored by the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Curtin International, Curtin University of Technology, this article enlightens the reader about technopreneurship. In this important think-piece, Professor Milton- Smith reflects on current realities; he addresses Australia's relatively weak innovation system and argues that a successful business model is a necessity. He shows that we can learn from successful facilitators of research commercialisation, such as Yissum, which is the research development company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Zernike, a venture capital company in the Netherlands. Although Yissum is a university-based company, it has established an unusual record of achievement in technology transfer. It is currently a large source of applied research projects, filing 30 to 40 patent applications per year and, at any one time, promoting around 200 projects.

AB This paper aims at identifying some implications for the Korean ex-ante preparation of S and T integration. In particular, it focuses on the differences in the S and T systems between South and North Korea. There are some similarities between both systems. There is a strong tendency toward regional concentration of research capacities in a few regions. The public research sector is not functionally divided but some public research institutes carry out comprehensive R and D activities in respective areas. University research is poor in both countries.
   However, there are strong differences between the two systems. First, South Korean S and T policy has always been to enhance national competitiveness, while North Korean is to support the realization of the socialist revolution. Second, there are several ministries in South Korea that engage in R and D promotion, but there is no ministry-level organization for S and T policy in North Korea and the Labor Party's Office of Science and Technology is very influential in S and T policy. Third, there are about 25 government-sponsored research institutes under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in South Korea, while major R and D activities in North Korea are concentrated in four Academies and a research center. Fourth, South Korean universities have started to play an important role in the national innovation system, but North Korean universities have not shown any satisfactory R and D activities. Finally, South Korean industry is the most important actor in the national innovation system, while North Korean industry has had not much of any role in the national innovation system.
   This paper argues that these differences should be taken into account in the unification of the South and North Korean innovation systems. It expects that the South Korean system will be the frame of reference for the North Korean system in the unification process. In this sense, the current South Korean system needs to be significantly improved. Unification should be utilized as a valuable opportunity for formulating a competent, unified innovation system for Korea. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diversified but complimentary approaches analysing complex systems of innovation promise a more general framework of relevant theory that can explain similarities and differences of national innovation systems (NIS) among countries. We characterize this approach as a breakthrough for overcoming the restrictions of the prevailing Linear Approach and System Approach. The combination of these two approaches facilitates cross-country and cross-time comparisons of different systems of innovations. The new approach also contributes to understanding fine-tuning links between the national innovation system and the corporate innovation system.

AB Since political independence in 1965, Singapore has achieved remarkable economic growth through continuous industrial re-structuring and technological upgrading, This paper presents a framework suitable for analysing the national innovation system of small, late-industrializing economies, and applies it to examine how Singapore's national innovation system has transformed over the years, and how public S&T policy has changed in response to the changing needs of the innovation system. In particular, the paper highlights four generic stages in the evolution of Singapore's national innovation system, with the emphasis of public S&T policy shifting from assimilation and diffusion of technology through leveraging foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) to include an increasing focus on promoting indigenous R&D and technopreneurial start-ups in recent years. Implications from the analysis for Singapore's future public S&T policy challenges are discussed.

AB Although wheat breeding is of limited profitability if compared to other crops, a viable private sector committed to wheat breeding is found in many countries with commercial agriculture. "The private sector" has been usually perceived as a rather uniform block, and its remarkable diversity is often overlooked. (S) under bar mall and medium size (P) under bar rivatly owned plant breeding (C) under bar ompanies (SPCs) play a major role in germplasm and variety development in Germany and other european countries. SPCs have good potential to increase the overall efficiency of national/regional wheat research systems elsewhere as well. Policy-makers concerned with the design of an efficient national innovation system should take into consideration the comparative advantages and actual and potential contributions of public research insitutions, SPCs, and (m) under bar ultinational (c) under bar orporations (MNCs) in a systematic way to identify the optimum mode of cooperation and division of labour.

AB It is found that patents in China are highly clustered in two groups of provinces: one is the economically fast growing coastal provinces; and the other is inland provinces with large bases of populations, while the degree of spatial concentration of patents is declining over time. It is also revealed that export, together with 'technical infrastructure' including producer services and development of technology transfer market explains most of the provincial variation of patents. Furthermore, foreign ventures do not seem to be an important player in China's innovation system, while both state-owned and collective-owned industries contribute significantly to creations of new products in China. Finally, some commonly cited significant factors for innovations in western literature such as research and development (R&D) and agglomeration do not seem to explain the spatial distribution of patents in China. It is argued that such discrepancies between western 'common sense' and Chinese experience are largely attributed to China's inefficient innovation system, which has not been able to develop its potentiality.

AB As a basis for policy decisions, governments are increasingly using analysis of systems of innovation. Fundamental to the systems of innovation approach is the recognition that innovation processes essentially are interactive activities.
   The present paper illustrates the use and limitations of bibliometries in analysing the knowledge production and knowledge flows in a section of an innovation system focusing on life science subject fields relevant to innovation processes in biotechnology. Bibliometrics can in this context be used to identify the actors in a research intensive innovation system, the scientific profiles of actors as well as identifying networks and collaboration patterns.

AB Since the early 1980s, the Chinese government has been driving the evolution of an endogenous innovation system. Various policies were adopted to foster the improvement of technological capabilities in the past two decades. The characteristics of the Chinese innovation system have been gradually reshaped. Such structural evolution affects the development of the Chinese biotechnology industry as well. The purpose of this study is to investigate the significance of the changes in the Chinese innovation system for biotechnology transfer Three major trends have been discerned.
   First, the enhancement of a patent system has provided a vehicle for innovators lo convert knowledge into marketable formats. Filing for patent protection is becoming an ordinary practice across industries. Second, the formalization of the business contract system has demonstrated great effect on the user-producer interactions between international biotechnology firms and their Chinese counterparts. Third, biotechnology research has become one of the most popular industries in China. Due to the increasing mobility of the research and development (R&D) workforce and the restructuring of the R&D financing scheme, Scientists and engineers are able to work where their knowledge is valued and needed most. Also, the concentration of research manpower and funds may encourage the positive feedback of China's biotechnology innovation system. International technology transfer can be an effective strategy to engage this positive cycle.

AB The historical contest of the Israeli defense industry is reviewed to identify the circumstances conducive to the emergence of R & D networks through which major defense firms are pursuing defense conversion today. Technology policies, organizational strategies, and the institutionalization of a particular view of national security, have influenced the membership structures of these networks and allowed few rich firms rather than many industrial firms to gain access to an increased pool of advanced technological knowledge. The case of the largest defense firm in Israel is presented and the system of R & D networks within the MAGNET Program is described. The paper argues that Israel needs an explicit diffusion-oriented policy for technology as well as open networks to involve relevant stakeholders in the country (e.g. small firms, development organizations, and entrepreneurs). The paper details policy conclusions and emphasizes the feasibility to learn through networks, the need to reemit government leadership, to formulate and implement a coordinated policy for the management of the national innovation system, and above all, to expand the concept of national security so as to include social and economic aspects at individual and collective levels.

AB Most debates and discussions regarding trends towards globalization and localization, occur in the over-arching context of the knowledge economy, and focus on the impact of these trends on innovation and competitiveness in the 'Triad' of Europe, Japan and the USA. However, in the knowledge economy, competitiveness is increasingly based upon access to knowledge, in the form of skills and capabilities, wherever it is located in the world including the smaller industrialized countries. This paper extends the discussion of the impacts of globalization and localization to encompass other nations and their 'national innovation systems'.
   Policy underpinning national systems to encourage innovation is increasingly being called into question by the general move towards globalization and localization. Multi-national enterprises (MNEs) and localized clusters in the emerging technologies determine and control technological paths beyond and through national borders. Small industrialized nations which have neither a broad technological base, extensive science and technology infrastructure or resources, nor MNEs based in the country, run the risk of being marginalized when competing globally, through an inability to become involved in these international economic networks.
   A traditional policy response by small countries to the impact of globalization is to metaphorically 'batten down the hatches' against the invasion of MNEs and the exploitation of local resources. However, an exploration of the drivers of both globalization and localization in the knowledge economy, and the observed impacts of globalization on New Zealand, suggests that a suitable strategy for small nations might be the reverse scenario. By using the analogy of the small country as a small and medium sized enterprise (SME) in the global economy dominated by large nations and MNEs, SME advantages and disadvantages are mapped onto potential small county advantages and disadvantages. The simile is extended to propose a small-country strategy Based on exploiting the documented advantages of SMEs, such as flexibility and use of external networks, for an outward-looking supplier-orientated innovation policy. Such a policy has to be designed for rapid communication and flexibility, and has to encourage committed technological accumulation and networking, to maximise national absorptive and transformative capacities.

AB Over the past several years, it has been pointed out that public research institutes are less productive than private ones; moreover, they need to clarify their roles in the development of Korea's national system of innovation. With a view to identifying the causes of problems in public R&D activities, this study examines three pairs of government-sponsored research institutes (GSRIs) and private R&D organizations in Korea; it compares their strategic goals, the roles of their top managers, their organizational characteristics, and the attitudes of individual researchers.
   The results, based on responses from 570 R&D managers and professionals in both sectors, reveal the following: compared with private R&D organizations, GSRIs 1) have relatively less dear strategic goals and R&D objectives; 2) their R&D activities are very broad and not well focused; 3) their top management plays a biased external role in order to gain institutional legitimacy; 4) their organizational structure tends to be more decentralized but less flexible; 5) their R&D work climates exhibit higher autonomy, cohesiveness, work-pressure, and risk-taking propensity, but display lower customer-orientation and less fairness in a reward system; and 6) the researchers are dissatisfied with their jobs and organizational incentive systems, and also less committed to the organization.
   As an attempt to understand the root causes of the salient features of GSRIs, this study further explores the impacts of external environments over the period of their development, including the government Science and Technology policy, the national project funding and accounting systems, and institutional regulations, on their internal management systems. Findings of distinctive managerial features of GSRIs and their relationships with external environments suggest several managerial and policy implications for designing more effective R&D management systems of GSRIs in Korea.

ID FUTURE
AB This paper introduces the evolutionary process of technological innovation and technology management in Chinese enterprises since 1949. First, the transition of corporate management and technology management in China is introduced in comparison to Western-style management. Then, based on the historical description and case studies, the typical technology development process, especially the processes of technological acquisition, learning, and secondary innovation in Chinese enterprises, is analyzed, The integration between technology acquisition and in-house design and R&D is emphasized. The authors suggest that "assimilation and self-design upon imported technology" (3-I policy) is the suitable and vital technology development avenue for most Chinese firms. To accomplish such a technological avenue, coordination, which exists between product innovation and process innovation, corporate strategy and technology strategy, and technology evolution and organizational change must be organized well and dynamically, As Chinese firms face more severe competition than ever, more attention should be paid to the development of indigenous capabilities for technological innovation. The firms' innovation system (FIS), which emphasizes the infrastructure support for a firms entrepreneurship, R&D system, and organization, as well as high-talent personnel, should be established or improved. Thus, technology strategy and the technological innovation system are currently the two key issues of management of technology (MOT) in China and will continue to be into the coming century.

TI Technology transfer from manufacturers of arms systems for the
   Venezuelan Army
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB The main objective of this paper is to study the technology transfer processes and mechanisms of firms that supply the Venezuelan army. The study is focused on the following aspects:
   Classification of the technological level of the Army,
   Analysis of the functioning of the Army's Research and Development Department and the distribution of its human and financial resources,
   Study Of human resources and workshop equipment, Communications Laboratory and the Maintenance: Center for Armoured Vehicles and their present operativity,
   Establishment of the Army's technological vulnerability with repect to more modern arms systems in case of conflict.
   Requirements for technology transfer of supplier firms in arms systems acquisitions,
   Identification of national firms that support technology transfer processes,
   The novelty of the study lies in the importance of several factors in the world today. the need to have the technological level required by armies to enable them to gain dominion over the adversary in the different operating theatres; reconversion of the Latin American armies in the face of the change in the world scenario; the disappearance of bipolary and the decrease in the probability of highly intensive conflicts that is leading to the deactivation of war arsenals in the arms producing industrialized countries and their consequent sale to developing countries that are not producers of technology for military use.
   The research could be carried out as the following were available: bibliographical data on the problem, a review of contracts for acquiring technology for the Army, interviews with officers well versed in the matter; direct observations of the army's workshops and laboratories, services workshops and technical schools.
   In order to determine the technological level of the Army, the classification in the Ignacy Sachs normative model was used and it was found that this is a pseudo-transfer in which foreign technology does not play any other role than that of supplying production inputs or equipment operativity, without exerting any influence on local scientific and technological infraestructure. This is an important fact at a time when the creation of a national Innovation System is being proposed in Venezuela which would also include the military sector within its guidelines.
   The following are some of the results of the research:
   In relation to the Army, these is an inadequate policy of transfer and rotation of technically qualified staff with great potential for disintegrating, adapting and innovating tecnological packages.
   The Army has only been allocated a budget for expenditure on technological Research and Development of 0.00545% on average of the total Army budget for over the last ten years.
   It has been detected that in the most important of the Army's contracts with arms' systems suppliers for acquiring war material in the past few years, certain training has been acquired in the operativity and maintenance up to the fourth echelon. There is, however, no adequate support infraestructure for the disintegration, adaptation and innovation of technological packages in spite of the large amount of investment available in the Global Purchasing Plan as technology transfer has not been considered a priory.
   Lak of communication between the Army's Research and Development Department and similar departments in the other branches of the armed forces such as the Navy and Airforce and with universities and Science and Technology regulating bodies like CONICIT (with the exception of a very few experiences).
   Lack of production capacity for spare parts or new material required.
   Lack of coordination and integration with National Industry on the part of the Army's Logistics office, in the case of requisition or national mobilization.

AB The article reviews Spanish science and technology policy in the eighties. It assumes that these policies are not only the result of rational choice processes, but also the outcome of institutional arrangements and political battles. It develops a framework which considers that ideas, interests, and institutions must be part of the analysis and includes insights into the limits that political institutions impose on the social learning process about policies. With this frame it attempts to provide an explanation of the main reasons for the specific choices made in science and technology policy in Spain: Why was it included on the political agenda of the new socialist government? Why were the choices and institutions so much science oriented? Why was there no technology-innovation policy until the end of the decade? What was the dominant policy paradigm in science and technology policy? Which interests were at work? Why was he learning process about science and technology policies were so limited?

AB Baden-Wurttemberg has one of Germany's strongest regional economies. The robustness of the economic system rests on three key elements: dynamic vertical and horizontal networks between firms; a rich institutional system of vocational training; and substantial public and private investment in R&D, innovation and technology transfer. The paper analyses each of these in depth. It is concluded that networks of innovative economic activity between business and government are of key importance to the development process. Learning, monitoring and evaluation are crucial to the enhancement of the Baden-Wurttemberg innovation networks and lessons, suitably adapted, can be learned for application to less developed economies. Currently, the Land government and other key actors are engaged in a new round of learning which may lead to the further improvement of a system assailed by problems of global competition.

TI MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN A NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZED
   COUNTRY - TAIWAN
SO TECHNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Partly triggered by the Japanese VLSI program, Taiwan launched eight national technology programs in the early 1980s.  But because of its technologically 'imitative' and 'dependent' position, Taiwan's experience in these programs is rather different from most industrialized countries.  First, government has to play a pivotal role because industry lacks strong technical capability.  Secondly, a 'national champion', institutional adjustments and overall development framework are crucial.  Thirdly, the 'whole innovation process' approach is very instrumental by exposing the systemic weaknesses in the national innovation system and directing new investment.  Fourthly, technological convergence and standardization in advanced countries greatly helps concentrate national efforts.  Fifthly, there are many pitfalls in technology transfer and technical service to industry.  Finally, the national programs challenge administrative systems, major R&D institutes and the grand national plan to upgrade themselves.
